<h3>ANCESTRAL</h3>

<p>
These are my people, quaint and ancient,<br />
Gentlefolks with their prim old ways;<br />
This, their leader come from England,<br />
Governed a State in early days.<br />

<br />
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />

I must vanish with my ancients,<br />

Is around us and beneath us,<br />
Binds us to our home above.<br />
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 10em;">Julia Ward Howe.</span>
</p>

<p><br />Our mother was once present at a meeting where
there was talk of ancestry and heredity. One of the
speakers dwelt largely upon the sins of the fathers.
He drew stern pictures of the vice, the barbarism, the
heathenism of the "good old times," and ended by
saying with emphasis that he felt himself "<i>bowed down
beneath the burden of the sins of his ancestors</i>."</p>

<p>Our mother was on her feet in a flash.</p>

<p>"Mr. So-and-So," she said, "is bowed down by the
sins of his ancestors. I wish to say that all my life I
have been buoyed up and lifted on by the remembrance
of the virtues of mine!"</p>

<p>These words are so characteristic of her, that in beginning
the story of her life it seems proper to dwell
at some length on the ancestors whose memory she
cherished with such reverence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>The name of Ward occurs first on the roll of Battle
Abbey: "Seven hundred and ten distinguished persons"
accompanied William of Normandy to England,
among them "Ward, one of the noble captains."</p>

<p>Her first known ancestor, John Ward, of Gloucester,
England, sometime cavalry officer in Cromwell's army,
came to this country after the Restoration and settled
at Newport in Rhode Island. His son Thomas married
Amy Smith, a granddaughter of Roger Williams.
Thomas's son Richard became Governor of Rhode
Island and had fourteen children, among them Samuel,
who in turn became Governor of the Colony, and a
member of the Continental Congress. He was the only
Colonial governor who refused to take the oath to enforce
the Stamp Act. In 1775, in the Continental Congress,
he was made Chairman of the Committee of the
Whole, which from 1774 to 1776 sat daily, working
without intermission in the cause of independence.
But though one of the framers of the "Declaration,"
he was not destined to be a "signer." John Adams
says of him, "When he was seized with the smallpox
he said that if his vote and voice were necessary to
support the cause of his country, he should live; if not,
he should die. He died, and the cause of his country
was supported, but it lost one of its most sincere and
punctual advocates."</p>

<p>The correspondence between Governor Ward and
General Washington has been preserved. In one letter
the latter says: "I think, should occasion offer, I shall
be able to give you a good account of your son, as he
seems a sensible, well-informed young man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>This young man was Samuel Ward, Lieutenant-Colonel
of the First Rhode Island Regiment, and our
mother's grandfather.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In Trumbull's painting of the Attack on Quebec in
1776, there is a portrait of Lieutenant-Colonel Ward,
a young, active figure with sword uplifted. His life
was full of stirring incident. In 1775 he received his
commission as Captain, and was one of two hundred
and fifty of the Rhode Island troops who volunteered
to join Benedict Arnold's command of eleven hundred
men, ordered to advance by way of the Kennebec River
to reinforce General Montgomery at Quebec. In a
letter to his family, dated Point-aux-Trembles, November
26, 1775, Captain Ward says: "We were
thirty days in the wilderness, that none but savages
ever attempted to pass. We marched a hundred miles
upon shore with only three days' provisions, waded
over three rapid rivers, marched through snow and ice
barefoot, passed over the St. Lawrence where it was
guarded by the enemy's frigates, and are now resting
about twenty-four miles from the city to recruit our
worn-out natures. General Montgomery intends to
join us immediately, so that we have a winter's campaign
before us. But I trust we shall have the glory
of taking Quebec!"</p>

<p>The young soldier's hopes were vain. He was taken
prisoner with many of his men while gallantly defending
a difficult position, and spent a year in prison. On
his release he rejoined the army of Washington and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
fought through the greater part of the Revolution,
rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was at
Peekskill, Valley Forge, and Red Bank, and wrote the
official account of the last-named battle, which may be
found in Washington's correspondence.</p>

<p>During the terrible winter at Valley Forge, Lieutenant-Colonel
Ward obtained a month's furlough, wooed
and married his cousin, Ph&oelig;be Greene (daughter of
Governor William Greene, of Rhode Island, and of the
beautiful Catherine Ray,
<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>

 of Block Island), and returned
to the snows and starvation of the winter camp.
Our mother was very proud of her great-grandmother
Catherine's memory, treasured her rat-tail spoons and
her wedding stockings of orange silk, and was fond
of telling how Benjamin Franklin admired and corresponded
with her. Some of Franklin's letters have
been preserved. He speaks of his wife as the "old
lady," but says he has got so used to her faults that
they are like his own&mdash;he does not recognize them
any more. In one letter he gives the following advice
to the lovely Catherine: "Kill no more Pigeons than
you can eat. Go constantly to meeting or to church&mdash;till
you get a good husband; then stay at home and
nurse the children and live like a Christian."</p>

<p>Some years after the Revolution, Colonel Ward was
in Paris on a business errand. He kept a record of his
stay there in a parchment pocket-book, where among
technical entries are found brief comments on matters
of general interest. One day the Colonel tells of a dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
party where he met Vergniaud and other prominent
revolutionists. He was surprised to find them
such plain men; "yet were they exceeding warm."
On December 29,1792, he notes: "Dined with Gouverneur
Morris. Served upon plate&mdash;good wines&mdash;his
Kitchen neither french or English, but between both.
Servants french, apartments good.... I have visited
the halls of painting and sculpture at the Louvre. The
peices [sic] are all called <i>chef d'&oelig;uvres</i> by connoisseurs.
The oldest are thought the best, I cannot tell why,
though some of the old peices are very good. Milo
riving the oak is good...."</p>

<p>He went to the theatre, and observed that the features
which appeared to him most objectionable were
specially applauded by the audience.</p>

<p>Briefly, amid items of the sale of land, he thus notes
the execution of Louis XVI:&mdash;</p>

<p>"January 15th. The convention has this day decided
upon two questions on the King; one that he was
guilty, another that the question should not be sent to
the people.</p>

<p>"January 17th. The convention up all night upon
the question of the King's sentence. At eleven this
night the question was determined&mdash;the sentence of
death was pronounced. 366 death&mdash;319 seclusion or
banishment&mdash;36 various&mdash;majority of 5 absolute&mdash;the
King caused an appeal to be made to the people,
which was not allowed; thus the convention have been
the accusers, the judges, and will be the executors of
their own sentence&mdash;this will cause a great degree
of astonishment in America....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>"January 21st. Went to the Pont Royal to pass it at
nine o'clock. Guards prevented me from going over. I
had engaged to pass this day, which is one of horror, at
Versailles, with Mr. Morris. The King was beheaded
at eleven o'clock. Guards, at an early hour, took possession
of the <i>Place Louis XV</i>, and were posted in each
avenue. The most profound peace prevailed. Those
who had feeling lamented in secret in their houses, or
had left town. Others showed the same levity or barbarous
indifference as on former occasions. Hichborn,
Henderson, and Johnson went to see the execution, for
which, as an American, I was sorry. The King desired
to speak. He had only time to say he was innocent, and
forgave his enemies. He behaved with the fortitude of
a martyr. Santerre ordered the [executioner] to dispatch
him. At twelve the streets were again all open."</p>

<p>There is a tradition that when Colonel Ward quitted
Paris, with a party of friends, the carriage was driven
by a disguised nobleman, who thus escaped the
guillotine.</p>

<p>Our mother remembered him as a "gentleman advanced
in years, with courtly manner and mild blue
eyes, which were, in spite of their mildness, very
observing."</p>

<p>She inherited many traits from the Wards, among
them a force and integrity of purpose, a strength of
character, and a certain business instinct which sometimes
cropped up when least expected, and which
caused some of her family to call her the "banker's
daughter."</p>

<p>Those were also solid qualities which she inherited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
from the Rhode Island Greenes. Greenes of Warwick,
Greenes of East Greenwich; all through Colonial and
Revolutionary history we find their names. Sturdy,
active, patriotic men: Generals, Colonels, and Governors
of "Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,"
chief among them Governor William Greene, the
"War Governor," and General Nathanael Greene of
glorious memory.</p>

<p>Our liveliest association with the name of Greene
is the memory of Mrs. Nancy Greene, first cousin of
our grandfather Ward and daughter-in-law of the General
who died in Middletown, Rhode Island, in 1886,
at the age of one hundred and two. This lady was dear
to our mother as the one remaining link with her
father's generation. A visit to "Cousin Nancy" was
one of her great pleasures, and we children were
happy if we were allowed to accompany her. The old
lady sat erect and dignified in her straight-backed
chair, and the two discoursed at length of days gone
by. To Cousin Nancy "Julia" was always young,
though the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" was already
written when the old lady charged her to "cultivate
a literary taste." On another occasion&mdash;it
was one of the later visits&mdash;she said with emphasis,
"Julia, do not allow yourself to grow old! When you
feel that you <i>cannot</i> do a thing, <i>get up and do it!</i>" Julia
never forgot this advice.</p>

<p>Cousin Nancy never read a novel in her life, as she
announced with pride. She wished to read the "Annals
of the Schönberg-Cotta Family," but, finding it to be a
work of fiction, decided not to break her rule. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a fond and pious mother; when her son needed chastisement,
she would pray over him so long that he
would cry out, "Mother, it is time to begin whipping!"</p>

<p>If Julia Ward was part Ward and Greene, she was
quite as much Cutler and Marion; it is to this descent
that we must turn for the best explanation of her
many-sided character.</p>

<p>When she said of any relation, however distant, "He
is a Cutler!" it meant that she recognized in that person
certain qualities&mdash;a warmth of temperament, a
personality glowing, sparkling, effervescent&mdash;akin to
her own. If in addition to these qualities the person
had red hair, she took him to her heart, and he could
do no wrong. All this, and a host of tender associations
beside, the name of Cutler meant to her; yet it
may be questioned whether any of these characteristics
would have appeared in the descendants of Johannes
Demesmaker, worthy citizen of Holland, who,
coming to this country in 1674, changed his name to
Cutler for convenience' sake, had not one of these
descendants, Benjamin Clarke Cutler, married Sarah
(Mitchell) Hyrne, daughter of Thomas Mitchell and
Esther (or Hester) Marion.</p>

<p>To most people, the name of Marion suggests one
person only,&mdash;General Francis Marion of Revolutionary
fame; yet it was the grandfather of the General,
Benjamin Marion, of La Rochelle, who was the first of
the name to settle in this country, coming hither when
the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes drove the
Huguenots into exile. Brigadier-General Peter Horry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
friend and biographer of General Marion, quotes the
letter which told Benjamin of his banishment:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p>Your damnable heresy well deserves, even in this
life, that purgation by fire which awfully awaits it in
the next. But in consideration of your youth and worthy
connections, our mercy has condescended to commute
your punishment to perpetual exile. You will,
therefore, instantly prepare to quit your country forever,
for, if after ten days from the date hereof, you
should be found in any part of the kingdom, your miserable
body shall be consumed by fire and your impious
ashes scattered on the winds of heaven.</p>

<div class="signature">
(Signed)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Père Rochelle.</span><br />
</div></blockquote>


<p>Within the ten days Benjamin Marion had wound
up his affairs, married his betrothed, Judith Baluet,
and was on his way to America to seek his fortune. He
bought a plantation on Goose Creek, near Charleston,
South Carolina, and here he and his Judith lived for
many peaceful years in content and prosperity, seeing
their children grow up around them.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>Gabriel Marion, the eldest son of Benjamin, married
a young woman, also of Huguenot blood, Charlotte
Cordés or Corday, said to have been a relative of the
other Charlotte Corday, the heroine of the French
Revolution. To this couple were born six children, the
eldest being Esther, our mother's great-grandmother,
the youngest, Francis, who was to become the "Swamp
Fox" of Revolutionary days.</p>

<p>Esther Marion has been called the "Queen Bee" of
the Marion hive; she had fifteen children, and her descendants
have multiplied and spread in every direction.
She was twice married, first to John Allston, of Georgetown,
or Waccamaw, secondly to Thomas Mitchell,
of Georgetown. The only one of the fifteen children
with whom we have concern is Sarah Mitchell, the
"Grandma Cutler" of Julia Ward's childhood. This
lady was married at fourteen to Dr. Hyrne, an officer of
Washington's army. Julia well remembered her saying
that after her engagement, she wept on being told
that she must give up her dolls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Dr. Hyrne lived but a short time, and four years
after his death the twenty-year-old widow married
Benjamin Clarke Cutler, then a widower, Sheriff of
Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and third in descent
from John Demesmaker,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> before mentioned, sometime
physician and surgeon.</p>

<p>Our mother was much attached to "Grandma Cutler,"
and speaks thus of her in a sketch entitled "The
Elegant Literature of Sixty Years Ago": "Grandma
will read Owen Feltham's 'Resolves,' albeit the print
is too small for her eyes. She knows Pope and Crabbe
by heart, admires Shenstone, and tells me which scenes
are considered finest in this or that of Scott's novels.
Calling one day upon a compeer of her own age, she
was scandalized to find her occupied with a silly story
called 'Jimmy Jessamy.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Cutler had known General Washington, and was
fond of telling how at a ball the Commander-in-Chief
crossed the room to speak to her. Many of her letters
have been preserved, and show a sprightliness which is
well borne out by her portrait, that of a charming old
lady in a turban, with bright eyes and a humorous
mouth.</p>

<p>A word remains to be said about General Francis
Marion himself. This hero of history, song, and romance
was childless; our mother could claim as near
relationship to him as could any of her generation. She
was extremely proud of this kinship, and no one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
knew her could doubt that from the Marions she inherited
many vital qualities. One winter, toward the
end of her life, there was a meeting at the Old South
Church at which&mdash;as at the gathering described at the
beginning of this chapter&mdash;there was talk of ancestry
and kindred topics. The weather was stormy, our
mother well on in the eighties, but she was there. Being
called on to speak, she made a brief address in the
course of which she alluded to her Southern descent,
and to General Francis Marion, her great-great-uncle.
As she spoke her eyes lightened with mirth, in the way
we all remember: "General Marion," she said, "was
known in his generation as the 'Swamp Fox'; and when
I succeed in eluding the care of my guardians, children
and grandchildren, and coming to a meeting like
this, I think I may be said to have inherited some of
his characteristics!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>LITTLE JULIA WARD</h3>

<h4>1819-1835; <i>aet.</i> 1-16</h4>

<p>FROM MY NURSERY: FORTY-SIX YEARS AGO</p>


<p>
When I was a little child,<br />
Said my passionate nurse, and wild:<br />
"Wash you, children, clean and white;<br />
God may call you any night."<br />
<br />
Close my tender brother clung,<br />
While I said with doubtful tongue:<br />
"No, we cannot die so soon;<br />
For you told, the other noon,<br />
<br />
"Of those months in order fine<br />
That should make the earth divine.<br />
I've not seen, scarce five years old,<br />
Months like those of which you told."<br />
<br />
Softly, then, the woman's hand<br />
Loosed my frock from silken band,<br />
Tender smoothed the fiery head,<br />
Often shamed for ringlets red.<br />
Somewhat gently did she say,<br />
"Child, those months are every day."<br />
<br />
Still, methinks, I wait in fear,<br />
For that wonder-glorious year&mdash;<br />
For a spring without a storm,<br />
Summer honey-dewed and warm,<br />
Autumn of robuster strength,<br />
Winter piled in crystal length.<br />
<br />
I will wash me clean and white;<br />
God may call me any night.<br />
I must tell Him when I go<br />
His great year is yet to know&mdash;<br />
Year when working of the race<br />
Shall match Creation's dial face;<br />
Each hour be born of music's chime,<br />
And Truth eternal told in Time.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">J. W. H.</span>
</p>

<p><br />Lieutenant-Colonel Ward had ten children, of
whom seven lived to grow up. The fifth child and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
son was Samuel, our mother's father, born in Warwick,
Rhode Island, May 1, 1786. When he was four
years old, the family moved to New York, where
the Colonel and his brother established themselves
as merchants under the firm name of Samuel Ward
&amp; Brother.</p>

<p>The firm was only moderately successful; the children
came fast. With his narrow income it was not
possible for the father to give his boy the college education
he desired; so at fourteen, fresh from the common
schools, Samuel entered as a clerk the banking house
of Prime &amp; King. While still a mere lad, an old friend
of the family asked him what he meant to be when he
came to man's estate.</p>

<p>"I mean to be one of the first bankers in the United
States!" replied Samuel.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-two he became a partner in the
firm, which was thereafter known as Prime, Ward &amp;
King.</p>

<p>In a memoir of our grandfather, the partner who
survived him, Mr. Charles King, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Money was the commodity in which Mr. Ward
dealt, and if, as is hardly to be disputed, money be the
root of all evil, it is also, in hands that know how to use
it worthily, the instrument of much good. There exist
undoubtedly, in regard to the trade in money, and
respecting those engaged in it, many and absurd prejudices,
inherited in part from ancient error, and fomented
and kept alive by the jealousies of ignorance
and indigence. It is therefore no small triumph to have
lived down, as Mr. Ward did, this prejudice, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
have forced upon the community in the midst of which
he resided, and upon all brought into connexion with
him, the conviction that commerce in money, like commerce
in general, is, to a lofty spirit, lofty and ennobling,
and is valued more for the power it confers, of
promoting liberal and beneficent enterprises, and of
conducing to the welfare and prosperity of society,
than for the means of individual and selfish gratification
or indulgence."</p>

<p>Mr. Ward's activities were not confined to financial
affairs. He was founder and first president of the Bank
of Commerce; one of the founders of the New York
University and of the Stuyvesant Institute, etc., etc.</p>

<p>In 1812 he married Julia Rush Cutler, second daughter
of Benjamin Clarke and Sarah Mitchell (Hyrne)
Cutler. Julia Cutler was sixteen years old at the time
of her marriage, lovely in character and beautiful in
person. She had been a pupil of the saintly Isabella
Graham, and her literary taste had been carefully cultivated
in the style of the day. One of her poems,
found in Griswold's "Female Poets of America,"
shows the deeply religious cast of her mind; yet she
was full of gentle gayety, loved music, laughter, and
pretty things.</p>

<p>During the first years of their married life, Mr. and
Mrs. Ward lived in Marketfield Street, near the Battery.
Here four children were born, Samuel and Henry,
and the two Julias. She who was known as "the first
little Julia" lived only four years. During her fatal illness
her father was called away by urgent business. In
great distress of mind, he arranged that certain tokens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
should inform him of the child's condition. A few days
later, as he was riding homeward, a messenger came to
meet him and silently laid in his hand a tiny shoe: the
child was dead.</p>

<p>Not long after this, on May 27, 1819, a second
daughter was born, and named Julia.</p>

<p>Julia Ward was very little when her parents moved
to "a large house on the Bowling Green, a region of
high fashion in those days."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Here were born three
more children: Francis Marion, Louisa Cutler, and
Ann Eliza. For some time before the birth of the last-named
child, Mrs. Ward's health had been gradually
failing, though every known measure had been used to
restore it. There had been journeys to Niagara and up
the Hudson, in the family coach, straw-color outside
with linings and cushions of brilliant blue. Little Julia
went with her mother on these journeys; the good elder
sister, Eliza Cutler, was also of the party; and a physician,
Dr. John Wakefield Francis, who was later to
play an important part in the family life. Julia remembered
many incidents of these journeys, though the
latest of them took place when she was barely four
years old. She sat in a little chair placed at the feet
of her elders, and she used to tell us how, cramped
with remaining in one position, she was constantly
moving the chair, bringing its feet down on those of
Dr. Francis, to his acute anguish. In spite of this, the
good doctor would often read to her from a book of
short tales and poems which had been brought for her
amusement, and she always remembered his reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of "Pity the sorrows of a poor old man," and how it
brought the tears to her eyes.</p>

<p>At Niagara Falls she asked Dr. Francis, "Who made
that great hole where the water came down?" and was
told "The great Maker of all!" This puzzled her, and
she inquired further, but when her friend said, "Do
you not know? Our Father who art in heaven!" she
"felt that she ought to have known, and went away
somewhat abashed."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>She remembered a visit to Red Jacket, the famous
Indian chief, at his encampment. Julia was given a
twist of tobacco tied with blue ribbon, which she was
to present to him. At sight of the tall, dignified savage,
the child sprang forward and threw her arms
round his neck, to the great discomfiture of both; baby
as she was, Julia felt at once that her embrace was
unexpected and unwelcome.</p>

<p>Sometimes they went to the pleasant farm at
Jamaica, Long Island, where Lieutenant-Colonel Ward
was living at this time, with his unmarried sons, and
his two daughters, Ph&oelig;be and Anne.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was an invalid saint. She lived in a darkened
room, and the plates and dishes from which she ate
were of brown china or crockery, as she fancied her
eyes could not bear white. Anne was equally pious, but
more normal. She it was who managed the farm, and
who would always bring the cheeses to New York herself
for the market, lest any of the family grow proud
and belittle the dignity of honest work.</p>

<p>It is from Jamaica that Mrs. Ward writes to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mother a letter which shows that though the tenderest
of mothers, she had been strictly imbued with the Old
Testament ideas of bringing up children.</p>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mother</span>,&mdash; ... I find myself better since
I came hither.... Husband <i>more devoted than ever</i>;
children sweet tho' something of a drawback on my
recovery.... Thus in one page, you have the whole
history of my present life, reading and thinking only
excepted, which occupy by far the greatest portion of
my time.... I was obliged to whip Julia yesterday
afternoon, and have been sick ever since in consequence
of the agitation it threw me into.... I felt
<i>obliged</i> to try Solomon's prescription, which had a
worse effect on me than on her.... I think it is the
last time, however, blow high or low, for she is as
nervous as her mama was at her age, at the sight
of a rod, and screamed herself almost to death; indeed
her nerves were so affected that she cannot get
over it and has cried all today, trembling as violently
as if she had the ague all the time I whipped her and
could not eat.</p></blockquote>


<p><br />Julia was to retain through life the memories of the
dear mother so early lost. She remembered her first
sewing-lesson; how being told to take the needle in one
hand she straightway placed the thimble on the other.
She remembered her first efforts to say "mother," and
how "muzzer" was all she could produce, till "the
dear parent presently said, 'if you cannot do better
than that, you will have to go back and call me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
"mamma."' The shame of going back moved me to
one last effort, and, summoning my utmost strength of
tongue I succeeded in saying 'mother.'"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>All devices to restore the young mother's failing
strength were in vain: soon after giving birth to the
fourth daughter, Ann Eliza, she died.</p>

<p>Her life had been pure, happy, and unselfish; yet her
last hours were full of anguish. Reared in the strictest
tenets of Evangelical piety, she was oppressed with
terror concerning the fate of her soul; the sorrows of
death compassed her about, the pains of hell gat hold
upon her. It is piteous to read of the sufferings of
this innocent creature, as described by her mourning
family; piteous, too, to realize, by the light of to-day,
that she was almost literally <i>prayed to death</i>. She was
twenty-seven years old when she died and had borne
seven children.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward's grief at the death of this beloved wife
was so extreme as to bring on a severe illness. For some
time he could not bear to see the child who, he thought,
had cost her mother's life; and though he gathered his
other children tenderly around him, the little Annie
was kept out of his sight.</p>

<p>By and by his father came to make him a visit and
heard of this state of things. Going to the nursery, the
old gentleman took the baby from its nurse, and carrying
it into the room where his son sat desolate, laid
it gently in his arms. From that moment the little
youngest became almost his dearest care.</p>

<p>He could not live with his sorrow in the same dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that had contained his joy. The beautiful house at
Bowling Green was sold, with the new furniture which
had lately been ordered to please his Julia, and which
the children never saw uncovered; and the family
removed to Bond Street, then at the upper end of
New York City.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ward," said his friends, "you are going out
of town!"</p>

<p>Bond Street in the twentieth century is an unlovely
thoroughfare, grimy, frowzy, given over largely to the
sale of feathers and artificial flowers; Bond Street in the
early part of the nineteenth century was a different
affair.</p>

<p>The first settler in the street was Jonas Minturn,
who about 1825 built No. 22. Mr. Ward came next.
The city was then so remote, one could hardly see the
houses to the south across the woods and fields.</p>

<p>The Ward children saw the street grow up around
them; saw the dignified houses, brick or freestone, built
and occupied by Kings, Halls, Morgans, Grinnells,
most of all by Wards. Mr. Ward was then at No. 16;
his father, the old Revolutionary soldier, soon came to
live at No. 7, with his daughter Anne; his brother
Henry was first at No. 14, then at No. 23; while his
brother John was to make No. 8 a dwelling beloved
by three generations.</p>

<p>Julia did not remember in what year her father
bought the tract of land at the corner of Bond Street
and Broadway. At first a large part of it was fenced in,
and used as a riding-ring by the Ward boys. There
was also, either here or at No. 16, something in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
way of a garden, which she thus recalls in an address
on horticulture, given in her later years:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My earliest horticultural recollections go back to
an enclosure, usually called a yard, in the rear of my
father's house in New York. When my little brother
and I were turned out to play there, we might just as
well have picked the bugs off the rosebushes as the
buds, of which we made wicked havoc. Not knowing
what to do with the flower border, we barbarized instead
of cultivating it. Being of extremely inquiring
minds, we picked the larkspurs and laburnums to
pieces, but became nothing the wiser for the process. A
little daily tuition might have transformed us into a
miniature Adam and Eve, and might have taught us
some things that these old friends of ours did not know.
But tuition to us then meant six or eight daily hours
passed in dry conversation with the family governess
or French master. No one dreamed of turning the
enamelled pages of the garden for us. We grew up
consequently with the city measure of the universe&mdash;your
own house, somebody else's, the trees in the park,
a strip of blue sky overhead, and a great deal of talk
about Nature read from the best authors. Much that
is most beautiful in the works of all the poets was perfectly
unintelligible to us, because we had never seen
the phenomena referred to; or if we had seen them, we
had not been taught to observe them. You will ask
where we passed our summers? In travelling, or at the
seashore, perhaps. But we took our city measure with
us, and were never quite at home beyond its limits."</p>

<p>She adds: "I state these facts only to show how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
much of the world's beauty and value may be shut out
from the eyes of a human being, by even a careful education!
This loss cannot easily be remedied in later
years. I myself had reached mature life before I experienced
the deep and calm enjoyments of country
life. The long, still summer days, the open, fragrant
fields, the shy wild blossoms, the song of birds; these
won me at last to delight in them&mdash;at first they
seemed to me only a void. It was a new gospel that the
meadows taught me, and my own little children were
its interpreters. I know now some country craft, and
could even trim fruit trees and weed garden beds. But
I have always regretted in this respect the lost time of
youth. When I made acquaintance with Nature, I was
too old to learn the skill of gardening. Year after year
in the savage island of Newport, where labor is hard to
hire, I have passed summers ungladdened by so much
as a hollyhock, and the garden I at last managed to
secure owes nothing to my skill or knowledge."</p>

<p>The truth is, people were afraid of the open air in
those days. Julia and her sisters sometimes went for a
drive in pleasant weather, dressed in blue pelisses and
yellow satin bonnets to match the chariot; they rarely
went out on foot; when they did, it was in cambric
dresses and kid slippers; the result was apt to be a cold
or a sore throat, proving conclusively to the minds
of their elders how much better off they were within
doors.</p>

<p>Julia's nursery recollections were chiefly of No. 16
Bond Street. Here the little Wards lived a happy but
somewhat sober life, under the watchful care of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
father, and their faithful Aunt Eliza, known in the
family as "Auntie Francis."</p>

<p>The young mother, in dying, had commended her
children specially to the care of this, her eldest sister,
whose ability had been tried and proved from childhood.
In 1810 her father, Benjamin Clarke Cutler,
died suddenly under singular and painful circumstances.
Her mother, crushed by this event, took to
her bed, leaving the care of the family to Eliza, then
fifteen years of age. Eliza took up the house-mother's
burden without question; nursed her mother, husbanded
the narrow resources of the household, brought
up the four younger children with a strong hand.
"There were giants in those days."</p>

<p>Nothing could daunt Eliza Cutler's spirits, which
were a perpetual cordial to those around her. She was
often "borrowed" by one member and another of the
family; she threatened to hang a sign over her door
with the inscription, "Cheering done here by the job
by E. Cutler." Her tongue could be sharp as well as
merry; witness many anecdotes.</p>

<p>The housekeeper of a certain millionnaire, calling
upon her to ask the character of a servant, took occasion
to enlarge upon the splendors of her employer's
establishment. "Mr. So-and-So keeps this; Mr. So-and-So
keeps that:&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" said Mrs. Francis; "it is well known
that Mr. So-and-So keeps everything, except the Ten
Commandments!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Mrs. Francis, how <i>could</i> you?" cried the poor
millionnaire when next they met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>In 1829 Eliza Cutler married Dr. John Wakefield
Francis, the historian of Old New York, the beloved
physician of a whole generation. He was already, as
has been seen, a member of the Ward household, friend
and resident physician. His tremendous vitality, his
quick sympathies, his amazing flow of vivid and picturesque
language, made him the delight of the children.
He called them by singular pet names, "Cream
Cheese from the Dairy of Heaven," "Pocket Edition of
Lives of the Saints," etc., etc. He sang to them odd
snatches of song which were to delight and exasperate
later generations:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"To woodman's hut one evening there came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A physician and a dancing-master:</span><br />
The wind did blow, io, io,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the rain poured faster and faster."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Edgar Allan Poe said of Dr. Francis that his conversation
was "a sort of Roman punch, made up of tragedy,
comedy, and the broadest of all possible farce."</p>

<p>In those days "The Raven," newly published, was
the talk of the town. Dr. Francis, meeting Poe, invited
him to come to his house on a certain evening, and
straightway forgot the matter. Poe came at the appointed
time. The Doctor, summoned to the bedside
of a patient, left the drawing-room hastily, and in the
anteroom ran into a tall, cadaverous figure in black.
Seizing him in his arms, he carried him into the drawing-room
and set him down before his wife. "Eliza,
my dear&mdash;the Raven!" and he departed, leaving
guest and hostess (the latter had never heard of "The
Raven"!) equally petrified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Mrs. Francis adored her husband, yet he must sometimes
have tried her patience sorely. One evening they
had a dinner party, eighteen covers, a state occasion.
Midway in the repast the Doctor rose, and begging the
guests to excuse him and his wife for a moment, led her,
speechless with amazement, into the next room. Here
he proceeded to bleed her, removing twelve ounces of
blood; replying to her piteous protestations, "Madam,
I saw that you were on the point of apoplexy, and I
judge it best to avert it."</p>

<p>In strong contrast with "Uncle Doctor" was "Uncle
Ben," the Reverend Benjamin Clarke Cutler, for many
years rector of St. Anne's Church, Brooklyn. This
uncle was much less to Julia's taste: indeed, she was
known to stamp her childish foot, and cry, "I don't
care for old Ben Cutler!" Nevertheless he was a
saintly and interesting person.</p>

<p>He was twelve years old at the time of his father's
tragic death, and was deeply influenced by it. His
youth was made unhappy by spiritual anguish, duty to
his widowed mother and the call to the ministry fighting
within him. The latter conquered. In his twenty-first
year he drew up, signed, and sealed "An Instrument
of Solemn Surrender of Myself, Soul and Body, to
God!" This document was in the form of a testament,
in which he solemnly ("with death, judgment and eternity
in view") gave, covenanted, and made over himself,
soul and body, all his faculties, all his influence in
this world, all the worldly goods with which he might
be endowed, into the hands of his Creator, Preserver,
and Constant Benefactor, to be his forever, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
his disposal. He goes on to say: "Witness, ye holy
angels! I am God's servant; witness, thou, Prince of
Hell! I am thy enemy, thy implacable enemy, from this
time forth and forevermore."</p>

<p>That this covenant was well kept, no one who reads
his memoirs and the testimony of his contemporaries
can doubt.</p>

<p>There are many anecdotes of Uncle Ben. Once, during
his early ministry, he was riding in a crowded stagecoach.
One of the passengers swore profusely and continuously,
to the manifest annoyance of the others.
Presently Dr. Cutler, leaning forward, addressed the
swearer.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "you are fond of blasphemy; I am
fond of prayer. This is a public conveyance, and for
the remainder of our journey, as often as you swear
aloud, I shall pray aloud, and we will see who comes off
best." The swearing stopped!</p>

<p>In his later years, he met one day a parishioner clad
in deep mourning for a near relative. The old clergyman
laid his hand on the crape sleeve. "What!" he
said sternly. "Heathen mourning for a Christian
saint!"</p>

<p>But of all the uncles (and there were many) the beloved
Uncle John Ward was always first. Of him,
through many years Julia's devoted friend and chief
adviser, we shall speak later on.</p>

<p>We have dwelt upon the generation preceding our
mother's, because all these people, the beautiful
mother so early lost, so long loved and mourned, the
sternly devoted father, the vivacious aunts, the stalwart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
uncles, were strong influences in the life of
Julia Ward.</p>

<p>The amusements of the little Wards were few, compared
with those of children of to-day. As a child of
seven, Julia was taken twice to the opera, and heard
Malibran, then Signorina Garcia, a pleasure the memory
of which remained with her through life. About
this time Mr. Ward's views of religious duty deepened
in stringency and in gloom. There was no more opera,
nor did Julia ever attend a theatre until she was a
grown woman. In Low Church circles at that time, the
drama was considered distinctly of the devil. The
burning of the first Bowery Theatre and of the great
theatre at Richmond, Virginia, were spoken of as
"judgments." Many an Evangelical pastor "improved"
the occasions from the pulpit.</p>

<p>The child inherited a strong dramatic sense from the
Marion Cutlers. She had barely learned to read when
she found in an "Annual" a tale called "The Iroquois
Bride," which she dramatized and presented to the
nursery audience, with herself for the bride, her brother
Marion for the lover, and a stool for the rock they
ascended to stab each other. The performance was not
approved by Authority, and the book was promptly
taken away.</p>

<p>Her first written drama was composed at the age of
nine, but even the name of it is lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward did not encourage intimacies with other
children. He felt strongly that brothers and sisters
were the true, and should be the only, intimates for one
another; indeed, the six children were enough to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a pleasant little circle of their own, and there were
merry games in the wide nursery. Sam, the eldest
born, was master of the revels in childhood, as throughout
his life. It was his delight, in the early morning, to
wrap himself in a sheet, and bursting into the room
where the little sisters slept, leap from bed to bed, announcing
himself as a ghost come to haunt them; or,
when the three ladies, Mrs. Mills, Mrs. Brown, and
Mrs. Francis (otherwise known as Julia, Louisa, and
Annie) were playing with their dolls, to whisper in
their ears that they must on no account venture near
the attic stairs, as an old man in red was sitting there.
Of course the little Fatimas must needs peep, and the
old man was always there, a terrible figure, his face
hidden. In "Bro' Sam's" absence it was Marion who
played the outlaw and descended like a whirlwind upon
the unhappy ladies, who were journeying through
dense and dreadful forests.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mills, Mrs. Brown, and Mrs. Francis were devoted
mothers, and reared large families of dolls. They
kept house in a wide bureau drawer, divided into three
parts. Our Aunt Annie (Mrs. Adolphe Mailliard)
writes: "Mrs. Mills' (Julia) dolls were always far
more picturesquely dressed than ours, although I can
say little for their neatness. Oh! to what numberless
parties they went, and how tipsy they invariably got!
I can see distinctly to-day the upset wagon (boxes, on
spools for wheels), and the muddy dresses, for they
always fell into mud puddles."</p>

<p>Marion was as pious as he was warlike. His morning
sermons, delivered over the back of a chair, were fervent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and eloquent; he was only seven years old when
he wrote to his Cousin Henry Ward, who was ill with
some childish ailment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not forget to say your prayers every morning
and evening. I hope that you trust in God; and, my
dear cousin, do not set your mind too much on Earthly
things! And my dear cousin, this is the prayer."</p>

<p>Follows the Lord's Prayer carefully written out. On
the next page of the same sheet, the eight-year-old
Julia adds her exhortation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Cousin, I hope that you will say the Prayer
which my Brother has written for you. I hear with
regret that you are sick, and it is as necessary as ever
that you should trust in God; love him, dear Henry,
and you will see Death approaching with joy. Oh,
what are earthly things, which we must all lose when
we die&mdash;to our immortal souls which never die! I
cannot bear the thought of anybody who is dying
without a knowledge of Christ. We may die before to-morrow,
and therefore we ought to be prepared for
death."</p>

<p>This was scarcely cheering for Henry, aged ten; as a
matter of fact, he was to have half a century in which
to make his preparations.</p>

<p>Some of the nursery recollections were the reverse of
merry. When Julia was still a little child, the old housekeeper
died. The children loved her, and Auntie Francis
did not wish them to be saddened by the funeral
preparations; she gave them a good dose of physic all
round and put them to bed for the day.</p>

<p>Julia was a beautiful child, but she had red hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
which was then considered a sad drawback. She could
remember visitors condoling with her mother on this
misfortune, and the gentle lady deploring it also, and
striving by the use of washes and leaden combs to
darken the over-bright locks. Still, some impression of
good looks must have reached the child's mind; for one
day, desiring to know what she really was like, she
scrambled up on a chair, then on a dressing-table, and
took a good look in the mirror.</p>

<p>"<i>Is that all?</i>" she cried, and scrambled down again,
a sadly disappointed child.</p>

<p>Her first lessons were from governesses and masters;
when she was nine years old, she was sent to a private
school in the neighborhood. She was placed in a class
with older girls, and learned by heart many pages of
Paley's "Moral Philosophy"; memorizing from textbooks
formed in those days a great part of the school
curriculum. She did not care especially for Paley, and
found chemistry (without experiments!) and geometry
far more interesting; but history and languages were
the studies she loved. She had learned in the nursery
to speak French fluently; she soon began the
study of Latin. Hearing a class reciting an Italian lesson,
she was enchanted with the musical sound of the
language; listened and marked, day after day, and
presently handed to the amazed principal a note correctly
written in Italian, begging permission to join the
class.</p>

<p>At nine years old she was reading "Pilgrim's Progress,"
and seeking its characters in the people she
met every day. She always counted it one of the books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which had most influenced her. Another was Gibbon's
"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," which she
read at seventeen.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>She began at an early age to write verse. A manuscript
volume has been preserved in which some of
these early poems were copied for her father.</p>

Beloved father,<br />
</p>

<p>Expect not to find in these juvenile productions
the delicacy and grace which pervaded the writings
of that dear parent who is now in glory. I am indeed conscious
of the many faults they contain, but my object in
presenting you with these (original) poems, has been to give
you a little memorial of my early life, and I entreat you to
remember that they were written in the eleventh, twelfth,
and thirteenth years of my life.</p>

<div class="signature">Your loving daughter<br />
<span class="smcap">Julia</span>.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The titles show the trend of the child's thought: "All
things shall pass away"; "We return no more"; "Invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to Youth" (1831!); "To my dear Mother";
"Mine is the power to make thee whole"; "To an
infant's departing spirit"; "Redeeming Love"; "My
Heavenly Home," etc., etc.</p>

<p>At Newport, in 1831, she wrote the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>MORNING HYMN</p>

<p>
Now I see the morning light,<br />
Shining bright and gay.<br />
God has kept me through the night;<br />
He will, if He thinks it right,<br />
Preserve me through this day.<br />
<br />
Let thy holy Spirit send<br />
Of heavenly light a ray;<br />
Thy face, oh! Lord, I fain would seek,<br />
But I am feeble, vain and weak;<br />
Oh, guide me in thy way!<br />
<br />
Let thy assistance, Lord, be given,<br />
That when life's path I've trod,<br />
And when the last frail tie is riven,<br />
My spirit may ascend to heaven,<br />
To dwell with thee, My God.<br />
</p>

<p>We cannot resist quoting a stanza from the effusion
entitled "Father's Birthday":&mdash;</p>

<p>
Louisa brings a cushion rare,<br />
Anne Eliza a toothpick bright and fair;<br />
And O! accept the gift I bring,<br />
It is a <i>daughter's</i> offering.<br />
</p>

<p>Julia's mind was not destined to remain in the evangelical
mould which must have so rejoiced the heart
of her father. In 1834, at the ripe age of fifteen, she
describes her</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
"Vain Regrets<br />
</p>

<p>written on looking over a diary kept while I was under
serious impressions":&mdash;</p>

<p>
Oh! happy days, gone, never to return<br />
At which fond memory will ever burn,<br />
Oh, Joyous hours, with peace and gladness blest,<br />
When hope and joy dwelt in this careworn breast.<br />
</p>

<p>The next poem, "The Land of Peace," breaks off
abruptly at the third line, and when she again began to
write religious verse, it was from a widely different
standpoint.</p>

<p>It may have been about this time that she tried to
lead her sisters into the path of poesy.</p>

<p>Coming one day into the nursery, in serious mood,
she found the two little girls playing some childish
game. Miss Ward (she was always Miss Ward, even in
the nursery!) rebuked them for their frivolity; bade
them turn their thoughts to graver matters, and
write poetry.</p>

<p>Louisa refused point-blank, but little Annie, always
anxious to please, went dutifully to work, and produced
the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>
He feeds the ravens when they call,<br />
And stands them in a pleasant hall.<br />
</p>

<p>"Mitter Ward" (to give him his nursery title) treasured
these tokens of pious and literary promise. He
even responded in kind, as is shown by some verses
which are endorsed:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">"From my dearest Father.</span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Julia Euphrosyne Ward</span> [<i>sic</i>]."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>His letters are full of playful affection. He would
fain be father and mother both to the children who
were now his all. Under the austere exterior lay a tenderness
which perhaps they hardly comprehended at
the time. It was in fact this very anguish of solicitude,
this passionate wish that they should not only
have, but be everything desirable and lovely, that
made him outwardly so stern. This sterner note impressed
itself so deeply upon the minds of his children
that the anecdotes familiar to our own generation
echo it. We see the little Julia, weary with long riding
in the family coach, suffering her knees to drop apart
childwise, and we hear Mr. Ward say: "My daughter,
if you cannot sit like a lady, we will stop at the
next tailor's and have you measured for a pair of
pantaloons!"</p>

<p>Or we hear the child at table, remarking innocently
that the cheese is strong; and the deep voice replying,
"It is no more so than the expression, Miss!"</p>

<p>The family was still at 16 Bond Street, when all the
children had whooping-cough severely, and were confined
to the house for many weeks. Mrs. Mailliard
writes of this time:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I remember the screened-off corner of the dining-room,
which was called the Bower, where we each retired
when the spasms came on, and the promises
which we vainly gave each other each morning to
choke rather than cough whilst Uncle Doctor made
his visit to the nursery; for the slightest sound from
one of us provoked the general order of a dose all
round."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>It was after this illness that Julia Ward first went to
Newport. A change of air was prescribed for the children,
and they were packed off to the farmhouse of
Jacob Bailey, two or three miles from the town of
Newport. Here they spent a happy summer, to be followed
by many others. They slept on mattresses
stuffed with ground corncobs; the table was primitive;
but there was plenty of cream and curds, eggs and
butter, and there was the wonderful air. The children
grew fat and hearty, and scampered all over the island
with great delight.</p>

<p>(But when they went down to the beach, Julia must
wear a thick green worsted veil to preserve her ivory-and-rose
complexion.</p>

<p>"Little Julia has another freckle to-day!" a visitor
was told. "It was not her fault, the nurse forgot her
veil!")</p>

<p>Julia recalled Newport in 1832 as "a forsaken, mildewed
place, a sort of intensified Salem, with houses of
rich design, no longer richly inhabited." She was to
watch through many years the growth of what was
always one of the cities of her heart.</p>

<p>But we must return to Bond Street, and take one
more look at No. 16. The Wards were soon to leave it
for a statelier dwelling, but many associations would
always cling about the old house. Here it was that
the good old grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel
Ward, used to come from No. 7 to talk business with
his son or to play with the children. Our mother had a
vivid recollection of once, when still a little child, sitting
down at the piano, placing an open music-book on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the rack (though she could not yet read music), and
beginning to pound and thump the keys with might
and main. The Colonel was sitting by, book in hand,
and endured the noise patiently for some time. Finally
he said in his courtly way, "Is it so set down in the
book, little lady?" "Yes, Grandpapa!" said naughty
Julia, and went on banging; the Colonel, who indeed
had little music, made no further comment. But when
a game of "Tommy-come-tickle-me" was toward, the
children must step in to No. 7 to share that excitement
with their grandfather, since no cards were permitted
under Mr. Ward's roof.</p>

<p>The year of the first Newport visit, 1832, was also
the terrible "cholera year." Uncle Ben Cutler, at that
time city missionary, writes in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The cholera is in Quebec and Montreal. This city
is beginning to be alarmed; Christians are waking up.
My soul, how stands the case with thee?"</p>

<p>And later:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am now in the midst of the pestilence. The cholera,
the universal plague, arrived in this city four weeks
ago. It has caused the death of over nine hundred persons.
This day the report of the Board of Health was
three hundred new cases and one hundred and thirty
deaths."</p>

<p>Many parts of the city were entirely deserted. Dr.
Cutler retained through life the vivid recollection
of riding down Broadway in full daylight, meeting
no living soul, seeing only a face here and there at
an upper window, peering at him as at a strange
sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>Newport took the alarm, and forbade steamboats
from New York to land their passengers. This behavior
was considered very cold-blooded, and gave rise to
the conundrum: "Why is it impossible for Newporters
to take the cholera? Answer: Because they have no
bowels."</p>

<p>Grandma Cutler was at Newport with the Wards
and Francises, and trembled for her only son. She implored
him to "flee while it was yet day." "My most
precious son," she cried, "oh, come out from thence! I
entreat you; linger not within its walls, as Lot would
have done, but for the friendly angels that drew him
perforce from it!"</p>

<p>The missionary stood firm at his post, and though
exhausted by his labors, came safe through the ordeal.
But Colonel Ward, who had not thought fit to flee
the enemy,&mdash;it was not his habit to flee enemies,&mdash;was
stricken with the pestilence, and died in New
York City, August 16. His death was a grievous blow
to Mr. Ward. Not only had he lost a loving and beloved
father, but he had no assurance of the orthodoxy
of that father's religious opinions. The Colonel was
thought in the family to be of a philosophizing, if not
actually sceptical, turn of mind; it might be that he
was not "safe"! Years after, Mr. Ward told Julia of
the anguish he suffered from this uncertainty.</p>

<p>It is with No. 16 Bond Street that we chiefly associate
the sprightly figure of "Grandma Cutler," who
was a frequent visitor there. The affection between
Mr. Ward and his mother-in-law was warm and lively.
They had a "little language" of their own, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was Lady Feltham (from her fondness for Feltham's
"Resolves," a book little in demand in the twentieth
century); and he was her "saucy Lark," or "Plato."
Mrs. Cutler died in 1836.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>"THE CORNER"</h3>

<h4>1835-1839; <i>aet.</i> 16-20</h4>

<p>
But well I thank my father's sober house<br />
Where shallow judgment had no leave to be,<br />
And hurrying years, that, stripping much beside,<br />
Turned as they fled, and left me charity.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">J. W. H.</span>
</p>


<p>The house which Mr. Ward built on the corner of
Bond Street and Broadway was still standing in the
middle of the nineteenth century; a dignified mansion
of brick, with columns and trimmings of white
marble.</p>

<p>In her "Reminiscences," our mother recalls the
spacious rooms, hung with red, blue, and yellow silk.
The yellow drawing-room was reserved for high occasions,
and for "Miss Ward's" desk and grand piano.
This and the blue room were adorned by fine sculptured
mantelpieces, the work of a young sculptor
named Thomas Crawford, who was just coming into
notice.</p>

<p>Behind the main house, stretching along Broadway,
was the picture gallery, the first private one in New
York, and Mr. Ward's special pride. The children
might not mingle in frivolous gayety abroad, but they
should have all that love, taste, and money could give
them at home; he filled his gallery with the best pictures
he could find. A friend (Mr. Prescott Hall), making
a timely journey through Spain, bought for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
many valuable pictures, among them a Snyders, a
Nicolas Poussin, a reputed Velasquez and Rembrandt.
It was for him that Thomas Cole painted the
four pictures representing "The Voyage of Life," engravings
from which may still be found in old-fashioned
parlors.</p>

<p>Some years later, when the eldest son, Samuel, returned
from Europe, bringing with him a fine collection
of books, Mr. Ward built a library specially for them.</p>

<p>This was the house into which the family moved in
1835, Julia being then sixteen years of age; this was
the house she loved, the memory of which was dear to
her through all the years of her life.</p>

<p>The family was at that time patriarchal in its dimensions:
Mr. Ward and his six children, Dr. and Mrs.
Francis and their four; often, too, "Grandma Cutler"
and other Cutlers, not to speak of Wards, Greenes, and
McAllisters. (Louisa, youngest of the Cutler sisters,
one of the most beautiful and enchanting women of
her time, was married to Matthew Hall McAllister.)
One and all were sure of a welcome at "The Corner";
one and all were received with cordial urbanity, first by
Johnson, the colored butler, later by Mr. Ward, the
soul of dignified hospitality.</p>

<p>Another inmate of the house during several years
was Christy Evangelides, a Greek boy, orphaned in a
Turkish massacre. Mr. Ward took the boy into his
family, gave him his education and a start in life.
Fifty years later Mr. Evangelides recalled those days
in a letter to his "sister Julia," and paid beautiful
tribute to his benefactor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>To all these should be added a host of servants and
retainers; and masters of various kinds, coming to
teach music, languages, even dancing, for the children
were taught to dance even if they never (or very seldom)
were allowed to go to dances. Many of these
teachers were foreign patriots: those were the days
when one French <i>émigré</i> of rank dressed the hair of
fashionable New York, while another made its salads,
the two going their rounds before every festivity.</p>

<p>Julia's musical education began early. Her first
teacher was a French artist, so irritable that the terrified
child could remember little that he taught her. He
was succeeded in her tenth year by Mr. Boocock, a
pupil of Cramer, to whom she always felt that she
owed a great deal. Not only did he train her fingers
so carefully that after eighty years they still retained
their flexibility, but he also trained and developed her
inborn taste for all that was best in music.</p>

<p>As she grew toward girlhood, the good master found
that her voice promised to be a remarkable one, and
recommended to her father Signor Cardini, formerly an
intimate of the Garcia family, and thoroughly versed
in the famous Garcia method. Under his care Julia's
voice developed into a pure, clear mezzo-soprano, of
uncommon range and exquisite quality. She felt all
through her life the benefit of those early lessons.</p>

<p>When she was eighty years old she attended a meeting
of the National Peace Society at Park Street
Church, Boston. The church was packed with people.
When her turn came to speak, the kindly chairman
said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are now to have the
great pleasure of listening to Mrs. Howe. I am going
to ask you all to be very quiet, for though Mrs. Howe's
voice is as sweet as ever, it is perhaps not quite so
strong."</p>

<p>"<i>But it carries!</i>" said the pupil of old Cardini. The
silver tone, though not loud, reached the farthest corner
of the great building; the house "came down" in a
thunder of applause. It was a beautiful moment for
the proud daughter who sat beside her.</p>

<p>Music was one of the passions of her life. Indeed,
she felt that it had sometimes influenced her even too
much, and in recording the delight she took in the trios
and quartets which Mr. Boocock arranged for her, she
adds: "The reaction from this pleasure, however, was
very painful, and induced at times a visitation of
morbid melancholy, which threatened to upset my
health."</p>

<p>She felt that "in the training of young persons, some
regard should be had to the sensitiveness of youthful
nerves, and to the overpowering response which they
often make to the appeals of music....</p>

<p>"The power and sweep of great orchestral performances,
or even the suggestive charm of some beautiful
voice, will sometimes so disturb the mental equilibrium
of the hearer as to induce in him a listless melancholy,
or, worse still, an unreasoning and unreasonable discontent."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In a later chapter of her "Reminiscences," she says:
"I left school at the age of sixteen, and began thereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to study in good earnest. Until that time a certain
over-romantic and imaginative turn of mind had interfered
much with the progress of my studies. I indulged
in day-dreams which appeared to me far higher in tone
than the humdrum of my school recitations. When
these were at an end, I began to feel the necessity of
more strenuous application, and at once arranged for
myself hours of study, relieved by the practice of vocal
and instrumental music."</p>

<p>These hours of study were not all passed at home. In
1836 she was taking certain courses at the boarding and
day school of Mrs. E. Smith, then in Fifth Avenue,
"first house from Washington Square."</p>

<p>The Italian master was a son of the venerable Lorenzo
da Ponte, who in his youth had written for
Mozart the librettos of "Don Giovanni" and "Le
Nozze di Figaro."</p>

<p>Four languages, English, French, German, and
Italian, Julia learned thoroughly; she spoke and wrote
them throughout her life correctly as well as fluently,
with singularly pure accent and inflection, and seldom
or never was at a loss for a word; nor was she less proficient
in history. For mathematics she had no gift, and
was wont to say that her knowledge of the science was
limited to the fact that four quarts made a gallon: yet
the higher mathematics had a mysterious attraction for
her, as an unexplored region of wonder and romance.</p>

<p>She was always a student. When she began the study
of German, she set herself a task each day; lest anything
should interfere to distract her mind, she had herself
securely tied to her armchair, giving orders that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was on no account to be set free before the appointed
hour.</p>

<p>This was characteristic of her through life. The
chain of habit once formed was never broken, and
study was meat and drink to her. Her "precious time"
(which we children saucily abbreviated to "P.T.") was
as real a thing to us as sunrise: we were not to break in
upon it for anything short of a fire&mdash;or a cut finger!</p>

<p>Many years later, she laid down for the benefit of
the younger generation these rules:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you have at your command three hours <i>per diem</i>,
you may study art, literature, and philosophy, not
as they are studied professionally, but in the degree
involved in general culture.</p>

<p>"If you have but one hour every day, read philosophy,
or learn foreign languages, living or dead.</p>

<p>"If you can command only fifteen or twenty minutes,
read the Bible with the best commentaries, and
daily a verse or two of the best poetry."</p>

<p>In the days when Julia was going round the corner to
Mrs. Smith's school, Sam was newly returned from a
long course of study and travel abroad, while Henry
and Marion were at Round Hill School under the care
of Dr. Joseph Greene Cogswell and Mr. George Bancroft.
The former was a beloved friend of the Ward
family, and often visited them. We have pleasant
glimpses of the household at this time, when the lines
of paternal guidance, though still firmly, were somewhat
less rigidly drawn.</p>

<p>Breakfast at "The Corner" was at eight in winter,
and at half past seven in summer, Mr. Ward reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
prayers before the meal, and again at bedtime. He
would often wake his daughters in the morning by
pelting them with stockings, crying, "Come, my rosebuds!"</p>

<p>The young people were apt to linger over the breakfast
table in talk. If this were unduly prolonged, Mr.
Ward would appear, "hatted and booted for the day,"
and say, "Young gentlemen, I am glad that you can
afford to take life so easily. I am old, and must work
for my living!"</p>

<p>Dinner was at four o'clock, supper at half past seven.</p>

<p>At table, Julia sat beside her father; he would often
take her right hand in his left, half unconsciously, and
hold it for some time, continuing the while to eat his
dinner. Julia, her right hand imprisoned, would sit
dinnerless, but never dreamed of remonstrating.</p>

<p>She had a habit of dropping her slippers off while at
the table. Mr. Ward one day quietly secured an empty
slipper with his foot, and then said: "My daughter, I
have left my seals in my room. Will you be so good as
to fetch them for me?" A moment's agonized search,
and Julia went, "one shoe off and one shoe on," and
brought the seals. Nothing was said on either side, but
the habit was abandoned.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward's anxious care for his children's welfare
extended to every branch of their conduct. One evening,
walking with Julia, he met his sons, Henry and
Marion, each with a cigar in his mouth. He was much
troubled, and said: "Boys, you must give this up, and
I will give it up too. From this time I forbid you to
smoke, and I will join you in relinquishing the habit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>He never smoked again; nor did the boys&mdash;in his
presence!</p>

<p>Three lads, young, handsome, brilliant, and eminently
social as were the Wards, could not be kept out
of society. They were popular, and would fain have
had Julia, the only one of the three girls who was old
enough, share in their pleasures; but this might not be.
Mr. Ward had money and sympathy to spare for every
benevolent enterprise, but he disliked and distrusted
"society"; he would neither entertain it nor be entertained
by it. Our mother quotes an argument between
him and his eldest son on this point:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said my brother, 'you do not keep in view the
importance of the social tie.'</p>

<p>"'The social what?' asked my father.</p>

<p>"'The social tie, sir.'</p>

<p>"'I make small account of that,' said the elder
gentleman.</p>

<p>"'I will die in defence of it!' impetuously rejoined
the younger.</p>

<p>"My father was so amused at this sally that he
spoke of it to an intimate friend: 'He will die in
defence of the social tie, indeed!'"</p>

<p>Julia's girlhood evenings were mostly spent at home,
with books, needlework, and music, varied by an occasional
lecture or concert, or a visit to some one of the
uncles' houses in the street, which ought, one would
think, to have been called "Ward Street," since at this
time almost the whole family connection lived there.</p>

<p>Much as Julia loved her home, her books and music,
she longed for some of the gayety which her brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
were enjoying. "I seemed to myself," she says, "like
a young damsel of olden times, shut up within an enchanted
castle. And I must say, that my dear father,
with all his noble generosity and overweening affection,
sometimes appeared to me as my jailer."</p>

<p>Once she expostulated with him, begging to be allowed
more freedom in going out, and in receiving visits
from the friends of her brothers. It may have been on
the occasion when he refused to allow the late Louis
Rutherford, of venerated memory, to be invited to
the house, "because he belonged to the fashionable
world."</p>

<p>Her father told her that he had early recognized in
her a temperament and imagination over-sensitive to
impressions from without, and that his wish had been
to guard her from exciting influences until she should
appear to him fully able to guard and guide herself.</p>

<p>Alas! the tender father meant to cherish a vestal
flame in a vase of alabaster; in reality, he was trying
to imprison the lightning in the cloud. When our
mother wrote the words above quoted, on the power
of music over sensitive natures, she was recalling these
days, and perhaps remembering how, denied the society
of her natural mates, her sixteen-year-old heart
went out in sympathy and compassion to the young
harper who came to take part in the trios and quartets,
and who fell desperately in love with her and was
summarily dismissed in consequence.</p>

<p>Yet who shall say that the father's austere régime
did not after all meet a need of her nature deeper than
she could possibly have realized at the time; that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
long, lonely hours, the study often to weariness,&mdash;though
never to satiety,&mdash;the very fires of longing
and of regret, were not necessary to give her mind that
temper which was to make it an instrument as strong
as it was keen?</p>

<p>The result of this system was not precisely what Mr.
Ward had expected. One evening (it was probably
after the marriage of his eldest son to Emily Astor,
when he joined perforce in the festivities of the time)
he did actually take Julia to an evening party. She did
not dance, but she was surrounded by eager youths all
the evening, and when her father summoned her to go
home, she was deep in talk with one of them. There
was no disobeying the summons; as she turned to take
her father's arm, Miss Julia made a little gesture of
farewell, fluttering the fingers of her right hand over
her shoulder, to cheer the disconsolate swain. Mr.
Ward appeared unconscious of this, but a day or two
later, on leaving the room where Julia was sitting, he
said: "My daughter,&mdash;" and fluttered his fingers over
his shoulder in precise mimicry of her gesture.</p>

<p>Another anecdote describes an occasion singularly
characteristic of both father and daughter.</p>

<p>Julia was nineteen years old, a woman grown, feeling
her womanhood in every vein. She had never been
allowed to choose the persons who should be invited to
the house: she had never had a <i>party of her own</i>. The
different strains in her blood were singularly diverse.
All through her life Saxon and Gaul kept house together
as peaceably as they might, but sometimes the
French blood boiled over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Calling her brothers in council, she told them that
she was going to give a party; that she desired their
help in making out lists, etc., but that the occasion and
the responsibility were to be all her own. The brothers
demurred, even Sam being somewhat appalled by the
prospect; but finding her firm, they made out a list of
desirable guests, of all ages. It was characteristic of her
that the plan once made, the resolve taken, it became
an obsession, a thing that must be done at whatever
cost.</p>

<p>She asked her father if she might invite a few
friends for a certain evening: he assented. She engaged
the best caterer in New York; the most fashionable
musicians; she even hired a splendid cut-glass chandelier
to supplement the sober lighting of the yellow
drawing-room.</p>

<p>The evening came: Mr. Ward, coming downstairs,
found assembled as brilliant a gathering as could have
been found in any other of the great houses of New
York. He betrayed no surprise, but welcomed his
guests with charming courtesy, as if they had come at
his special desire; the music sounded, the young people
danced, the evening passed off delightfully, to all save
the young hostess. She, from the moment when the
thing was inevitable, became as possessed with terror
as she had been with desire. She could think of
nothing but her father's displeasure, of the words he
might speak, the glances he might cast upon her. During
the whole evening, the cup of trembling was at her
lips.</p>

<p>The moment the last guest had departed, the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
brothers gathered round her. "We will speak to him!"
they cried. "Let us speak to him for you!"</p>

<p>"No!" said Julia, "I must go myself."</p>

<p>She went at once to the room where her father sat
alone. For a moment she could find no words; but none
were needed. Gravely but kindly Mr. Ward said he
was surprised to find that her idea of "a few friends"
differed so widely from his own; he was sorry she had
not consulted him more freely, and begged that in the
future she would do so. Then he kissed her good-night
with his usual tenderness, and it was over. The matter
was never mentioned again.</p>

<p>The Wards continued to pass the summers at Newport,
but no longer at good Jacob Bailey's farmhouse.
Mr. Ward had bought a house in town, which a later
generation was to know as "The Ashurst Cottage," on
the corner of Bellevue Avenue and Catherine Street.</p>

<p>Here the severity of his rule relaxed somewhat, and
the pretty house became the centre of a sober hospitality.
Indeed, Newport was a sober place in those
days. There were one or two houses where dancing
was allowed, but these were viewed askance by many
people.</p>

<p>One evening, a dancing party was given by a couple
on Bellevue Avenue. They had a manservant named
Salathiel, a person of rigid piety. When supper-time
came, Salathiel was not to be found. The other servants,
being questioned, said that he had rushed suddenly
out of the house, crying, "I won't stay to see
those people dancing themselves to hell!"</p>

<p>Though Julia might not dance, except at home, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
might and did ride; first, with great contentment, on a
Narragansett pacer, "Jeanie Deans," later on a thoroughbred
mare, a golden bay named Cora. Cora was
beautiful but "very pranky." After being several
times run away with and once thrown off, it was observed
by her sisters that Julia generally read her
Bible and said her prayers before her ride: she has herself
told us how, after being thrown off and obliged
to make her way home on foot, she would creep in at
the back door so that no one might see her.</p>

<p>She calls the "cottage" a "delightful house," and
speaks with special pleasure of its garden planted with
roses and gooseberry bushes by Billy Bottomore, a
quaint old Newport sportsman, who took the boys
shooting, and showed them where to find plover,
woodcock, and snipe. Billy Bottomore passed for an
adopted son of old Father Corné, another Newport
"character" of those days. This gentleman had come
from Naples to Boston, toward the end of the eighteenth
century, as a decorative artist, and had made
a modest fortune by painting the walls of the fine
houses of Summer Street, Temple Place, and Beacon
Hill. He chose Newport as his final home, because,
as he told Mr. Ward, he had found that the climate
was favorable to the growth of the tomato, "that
most wholesome of vegetables." The Ward boys delighted
in visiting Father Corné, and in hearing him
sing his old songs, French and Italian, some of which
are sung to-day by our grandchildren.</p>

<p>Father Corné lived to a great age. When past his
ninetieth year, a friend asked him if he would not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to revisit Naples. "Ah, sir," replied the old man, "my
father is dead!"</p>

<p>Our mother loved to linger over these old-time figures.
The name of Billy Bottomore always brought a
twinkle to her eye, and we never tired of hearing how
he told her, "There is a single sister in Newport, a
sempstress, to whom I have offered matrimony, but
she says, 'No.'" The single sister finally yielded (perhaps
when Billy inherited old Corné's money) and he
became a proud and happy husband. "She keeps my
house as neat as a nunnery!" he said. "When Miss E.,
the housekeeper, died, she nursed her and laid her out,
and when Father Corné died, she nursed him and laid
him out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Billy," broke in our Aunt Annie, "and she'll
lay you out too!"&mdash;which in due time she did.</p>

<p>He congratulated Julia on having girl-children only.</p>

<p>"Give me daughters!" he cried. "As my good old
Spanish grandfather used to say, give me daughters!"</p>

<p>"Of this Spanish ancestor," our mother says, "no
one ever heard before. His descendant died, without
daughter or son, of cholera in 185-."</p>

<p>We forget the name of another quaint personage, a
retired sea-captain, who once gave a party to which she
was allowed to go; but she remembered the party, and
the unction with which the kindly host, rubbing his
hands over the supper table, exclaimed: "Now, ladies
and gentlemen, help yourselves <i>sang froidy</i>!"</p>

<p>The roses and gooseberry bushes of the Newport
garden once witnessed a serio-comic scene. There was
another sea-captain, Glover by name, who had business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
connections with Prime, Ward &amp; King, and who
came to the house sometimes on business, sometimes
for a friendly call. He was a worthy man of middle age
and unromantic appearance; probably the eighteen-year-old
Julia, dreamy and poetic, took no more notice
of him than civility required; but he took notice of her,
and one day asked her to walk out in the garden with
him. Wondering much, she went. After some desultory
remarks, the Captain drew a visiting-card from
his pocket, wrote a few words upon it, and handed it
to his young hostess. She read:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"<i>Russell E. Glover's</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">heart is yours!"</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><i>Julia Ward</i>, on her father's death, 1839.</span><br /><br />
</p>


<p>In Julia's childhood her brother Sam was her ideal
and her idol. She describes him as a "handsome
youth, quick of wit and tender of heart, brilliant in
promise, and with a great and versatile power of work
in him." He had early shown special proficiency in
mathematics, and to the end of his life rejoiced in being
one of the few persons who clearly understood the function
called "<i>Gamma</i>." His masters expected great
things from him; but his brilliant and effervescent
spirit was forced into the Wall Street mould, with
kindly intent but disastrous effect. His life was checkered,
sun and shadow; but from first to last, he remained
the delight of all who knew him. Sam Ward;
Uncle Sam to three generations, his was a name to conjure
with: the soul of generosity, the essence of wit, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
spirit of kindliness. No one ever looked in his face, ever
met the kindling glance of his dark eyes, ever saw the
sunshine break in his smile, without forgetting all else
in love and admiration of one of the most enchanting
personalities that ever brightened the world.</p>

<p>Sam Ward returned from Europe in 1835, and took
up his residence under his father's roof. In 1838 he
married Emily, daughter of William B. Astor. The
wedding was a grand one. Julia was first bridesmaid,
and wore a dress of white <i>moiré</i>, then a material of the
newest fashion. Those were the days of the <i>ferronière</i>,
an ornament then so popular that "evening dress
was scarcely considered complete without it."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Julia
begged for one, and her father gave her a charming
string of pearls, which she wore with great contentment
at the wedding.</p>

<p>The young couple took up their residence with the
family at "The Corner," the Francises having by this
time moved to a house of their own.</p>

<p>With all these changes, little by little, the discipline
relaxed, the doors opened wider. The bridal pair,
<i>fêted</i> everywhere, must, in their turn, entertain their
friends; and in these entertainments the daughters of
the house must have their share.</p>

<p>Julia Ward was now nineteen, in the fulness of her
early bloom. Her red-gold hair was no longer regarded
as a misfortune; her gray eyes were large and well
opened; her complexion of dazzling purity. Her finely
chiselled features, and the beauty of her hands and
arms, made an <i>ensemble</i> which could not fail to impress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
all who saw her. Add to this her singing, her wit, and
the charm which was all and always her own, and we
have the <i>Diva Julia</i>, as she was called by some who
loved her. Her sisters, also, were growing up, each
exquisitely attractive in her way: they became known
as the "Three Graces of Bond Street." Louisa was like
a damask rose, Annie like a dark lily; dark, too, of eyes
and hair were Sam and Marion, while Henry was fair
and blue-eyed.</p>

<p>At this distance of time, it may not be unpardonable
to touch briefly on another aspect of our mother's
youth; indeed, it would hardly be candid to avoid it.
From the first she seems to have stirred the hearts of
men. Her masters, old and young, fell in love with her
almost as a matter of course. Gilded youth and sober
middle-age fared no better; her girlhood passed to the
sound of sighing.</p>

<p>"My dear," said an intimate friend of the three,
speaking of these days, "Louisa had her admirers, and
Annie had hers; but when the men saw your mother,
they just <i>flopped</i>!"</p>

<p>Among her papers we have found many relics of
these days, from the faded epistle addressed, "<i>à Julie,
la respectée</i>, <i>la choisie</i>, <i>l'aimée</i>, <i>la chérie</i>," to the stern
letter in which Mr. Ward "desires not to conceal from
the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; the deliberate and dispassionate
opinion, that a gentleman whose sacred office commanded
ready access to his roof, might well have
earlier ascertained the views of a widow'd Father on
a subject so involving the happiness of his child."</p>

<p>The unhappy suitor's note to Miss Julia is enclosed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and Mr. Ward trusts that "the return will be considered
by the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; as finally terminating
the matter therein referred to."</p>

<p>Julia had for her suitors a tender and compassionate
sympathy. She could not love them, she would not
marry them, but she was very sorry for them, and&mdash;it
must be admitted&mdash;she liked to be adored. So she
sang duets with one, read German with another, Anglo-Saxon
with a third; for all, perhaps, she may have had
something the feeling of her "<i>Coquette et Tendre</i>" in
"Passion Flowers."</p>

<p>
Ere I knew life's sober meaning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nature taught me simple wiles,</span><br />
Gave this color, rising, waning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gave these shadows, deepening smiles.</span><br />
<br />
More she taught me, sighing, singing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Taught me free to think and move,</span><br />
Taught this fond instinctive clinging<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the helpful arm of love.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The suitors called her "<i>Diva</i>," but in the family
circle she was "Jules," or "Jolie Julie." The family
letters of this period are full of affectionate cheerfulness.</p>

<p>When "Jolie Julie" is away on a visit, the others
send her a composite letter. Louisa threatens to shut
her up on her return with nothing to read but her
Anglo-Saxon grammar and "Beowulf." ("If that does
not give you a distaste for all wolves," she says, "not
excepting those <i>Long fellows</i>,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> I do not know what
will!")</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>Annie tells of opening the window in Julia's room
and of all the poetical ideas flying out and away.</p>

<p>Emily, her brother's wife, describes Mr. Ward sighing,
"Where is my beauty?" as he sits at the table; and
the letter closes with a lively picture of the books in the
library "heaving their dusty sides in sorrow for her
absence."</p>

<p>In describing life at "The Corner," we must not forget
the evenings at No. 23, Colonel Henry Ward's
house. Uncle Henry and his namesake son (the boy
who was to "see death approaching with joy"!) were
musical. When Mr. Ward permitted (in his later and
more lenient days) an informal dance at "The Corner,"
the three girls sent for Uncle Henry as naturally as
they sent for the hair-dressing and salad-making <i>émigrés</i>;
and the stately, handsome gentleman came, and
played waltzes and polkas with cheerful patience all
the evening.</p>

<p>On Sunday the whole family from "The Corner"
took tea with Uncle Henry, and music was the order of
the evening. Mr. Ward delighted in these occasions,
and was never ready to go home. When Uncle Henry
thought it was bedtime, he would go to the piano and
play the "Rogue's March."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(Twice flogged for stealing a sheep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thrice flogged for de<i>sar</i>tion!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If ever I go for a soldier again,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The devil may be my portion!</span><br />
</p>
<p>We hear the fife shrill through the lively air!)</p>

<p>"No! no, Colonel!" Mr. Ward would cry. "We
won't march yet; give us half an hour more!" And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in affectionate mischief he would stay the half-hour
through before marshalling his flock back to "The
Corner."</p>

<p>A stern period was put to all this innocent gayety by
the death of Mr. Ward, at the age of fifty-three. His
life, always laborious, had been doubly so since the
death of his wife. Stunned at first by the blow, his
strong sense of duty soon roused him to resume his
daily responsibilities&mdash;with a difference, however.
Religion had always been a powerful factor in his life;
henceforth it was to be his main inspiration, and he
found his chief comfort in works of public and private
beneficence.</p>

<p>An earnest patriot, he was no politician; but when
his services were needed by city, state, or country, they
were always forthcoming. Throughout the series of
financial disasters beginning with Andrew Jackson's
refusal to renew the charter of the Bank of the United
States, and culminating in the panic of 1837, Mr. Ward
acted with vigor, decision, and sagacity. His denunciation
of the removal of the public deposits from the
Bank of the United States by the famous Specie Circular
as "an act so lawless, violent, and fraught with disaster,
that it would and must eventually overthrow the
men and the party that resorted to it," was justified,
literally and entirely.</p>

<p>The crisis of 1836-37 called for all the strength, wisdom,
and public spirit that the men of the country
could show. Mr. Ward labored day and night to prevent
the dishonor of the banks of New York.</p>

<p>"Individual effort, however, was vain, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
10th of May saw all the banks reduced to suspend
specie payments; and upon no man did that disastrous
day close with deeper mortification than upon
him. Personally, and in his business relations, this
event affected Mr. Ward as little possibly as any one
at all connected with affairs; but, in his estimation,
it vitally wounded the commercial honor and character
of the city. He was not, however, a man to
waste, in unavailing regrets, hours that might be
more advantageously employed to repair the evil, and
he therefore at once set about the arrangement of
measures for inducing and enabling the banks to resume
at the earliest possible moment."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>This was accomplished within the year. About the
same time the Bank of England sent to Prime, Ward &amp;
King a loan of nearly five million dollars in gold. Mr.
King says, "This extraordinary mark of confidence,
this well-earned tribute to the prudence and integrity
of the house, Mr. Ward did not affect to undervalue,
and confirming, as it did, the sagacity of his own views,
and the results which he had so confidently foretold, it
was not lost upon the community in the midst of which
he lived."</p>

<p>Our mother never forgot the afternoon when Brother
Sam came into her study on his return from Wall Street
and cried out to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Julia, men have been going up and down the office
stairs all day long, carrying little wooden kegs of gold
on their backs, marked 'Prime, Ward &amp; King' and
filled with English gold!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>That English gold saved the honor of the Empire
State, and the fact that her father procured the loan
was the greatest asset in her inheritance from the old
firm.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward did not see the kegs, for he was in bed,
prostrated by a severe fit of sickness brought on by his
labors for the public honor. The few years that remained
to him were a very martyrdom, his old enemy,
rheumatic gout, attacking him more and more fiercely;
but his spirit was indomitable. He labored almost
single-handed to establish the Bank of Commerce, and
became its first president, stipulating that he should
receive no compensation. What he did receive was his
death-warrant. The dampness of the freshly plastered
walls of the new building brought on in the spring of
1839 two successive attacks so severe that he could not
rally from them. Still he toiled on, giving all his energies
to perfect and consolidate the enterprise which he
believed would be of lasting benefit to his beloved city.</p>

<p>In October of the same year came another financial
crisis. The banks of Philadelphia and the Southern
States suspended specie payments, and every effort
was made to induce the New York banks to follow suit.
Mr. Ward was ill at Newport, but hearing the news
he hurried back and threw himself into the conflict,
exhorting, sustaining, encouraging.</p>

<p>A friend protested, warning him of the peril to his
enfeebled health of such exertions. "I should esteem
life itself not unworthily sacrificed," said Mr. Ward,
"if by word or deed, I could aid the banks in adhering
faithfully to their duty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>For nearly two weeks he labored, till the work was
done, his city's honor and fair fame secure; then he
went home literally to die, departing this life, November
27, 1839.</p>

<p>Julia was with him when he died, his hand in hers.
The beauty of his countenance in death was such that
Anne Hall, the well-known miniature painter, begged
permission to paint it, and his descendants may still
gaze on the majestic features in their serene repose.</p>

<p>Our mother writes of this time: "I cannot, even now,
bear to dwell upon the desolate hush which fell upon
our house when its stately head lay, silent and cold, in
the midst of weeping friends and children."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Her love for her father was to cease only with her
life. She never failed to record his birthday in her
diary, with some word of tender remembrance.</p>

<p>Shortly before Mr. Ward's death, Sam and his wife
had moved to a house of their own. The five unmarried
children would have been desolate, indeed, if left
to themselves in the great house: but to the joy and
comfort of all, their bachelor uncle, John Ward, left his
own house and came to live with them. From this time
until his death in 1866, he was a second father to them.</p>

<p><i>Uncle John!</i> The words call up memories of our own
childhood. We see a tall, stalwart figure, clad in loose-fitting
garments; a noble head crowned by a small
brown scratch wig; a countenance beaming with kindliness
and humor. A Manila cheroot is between his lips&mdash;the
fragrance of one never fails to call up his image&mdash;and
he caresses an unamiable little dog which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fondly loves. He offers a grand-niece a silk dress if she
will make it up herself. This was the "Uncle John" of
No. 8 Bond Street, one of the worthies of Wall Street,
and uncle, by courtesy, to half New York.</p>

<p>In his youth he had received an injury which deprived
him of speech for more than a year. It was
feared that he would never speak again; one day his
mother, trying to help him in some small matter, and
not succeeding to her mind, cried, "I am a poor, awkward,
old woman!"</p>

<p>"<i>No, you are not!</i>" exclaimed John Ward; and the
trouble was over.</p>

<p>His devotion to his orphan nieces and nephews was
constant and beautiful. He desired ardently that the
three girls should be good housekeepers, and grudged
the amount of time which one of them at least devoted
to books and music. To them also he was fond of giving
dress-materials, with the proviso that they should
make them up for themselves. This they managed to
do, "with a good deal of help from the family seamstress."</p>

<p>When Julia published her first literary venture, a
translation of Lamartine's "Jocelyne," Uncle John
showed her a favorable notice of it in a newspaper, saying:
"This is my little girl who knows about books, and
writes an article and has it printed, but I wish she knew
more about housekeeping."</p>

<p>"A sentiment," she adds, "which in after years I
had occasion to echo with fervor."</p>

<p>While Sam was her ideal of youthful manhood,
Henry was her mate, the nearest to her in age and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in sympathy. The bond between them was close and
tender; and when in October, 1840, he died of typhoid
fever, the blow fell on her with crushing severity.</p>

<p>"When he closed his eyes," she says, "I would
gladly, oh, so gladly have died with him!" And again,
"I remember the time as one without light or comfort."</p>

<p>She turned to seek consolation in religion, and&mdash;naturally&mdash;in
that aspect of religion which had been
presented to her childish mind as the true and only
one. At this time a great Calvinistic revival was going
on in New York, and a zealous friend persuaded Julia
to attend some of the meetings. In her anguish of grief,
the gloomy doctrines of natural depravity, of an angry
and vengeful Deity, of a salvation possible only through
certain strictly defined channels, came home to her
with terrible force. Her deeply religious nature sought
the Divine under however portentous an aspect it was
presented; her poet's imagination clung to the uplifted
Cross; these were days of emotion, of fervor, of exaltation
alternating with abasement; <i>thought</i> was to come
later.</p>

<p>While under these influences, Julia, now at the head
of the household, enforced her Calvinistic principles
with rigor. The family were allowed only cold meat on
Sunday, to their great discomfort; the rather uninviting
midday dinner was named by Uncle John "Sentiment";
but at six o'clock they were given hot tea, and
this he called "Bliss." Pious exhortations, sisterly admonitions,
were the order of the day. "The Old Bird"&mdash;this
<i>nom de tendresse</i> had now superseded "Jolie
Julie," and was to be hers while her sisters and brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
lived&mdash;hovered over the younger ones with maternal
anxiety. In the poems and letters of this period, she
adopts unconsciously the phraseology of the day.</p>

<p>Being away on a visit, she writes to her sisters: "Believe
me, it is better to set aside, untasted, the cup of
human enjoyment, than to drink it to the bitter dregs,
and then seek for something better, which may not be
granted to us. The <i>manna</i> fell from heaven early in the
morning, those who then neglected to gather it were
left without nourishment; it is early in life's morning
that we must gather the heavenly food, which can alone
support us through the burden and heat of the day."</p>

<p>The emotional fervor of this time was heightened by
a complication which arose from it. A young clergyman
of brilliant powers and passionate nature fell
deeply in love with Julia, and pressed his suit with
such ardor that she consented to a semi-engagement.
Fortunately, a visit to Boston gave her time to examine
her feelings. Relieved from the pressure of a
twofold excitement, breathing a calmer and a freer
air, she realized that there could be no true union
between her and the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, and the connection
was broken off.</p>

<p>The course of Julia's studies had for some years been
leading her into wider fields of thought.</p>

<p>In her brother's library she found George Sand and
Balzac, and read such books as he selected for her.
In German she became familiar with Goethe, Jean
Paul, and Matthias Claudius. She describes the sense
of intellectual freedom derived from these studies as
"half delightful, half alarming."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Mr. Ward one day had undertaken to read an English
translation of "Faust" and came to her in great
alarm. "My daughter," he said, "I hope that you
have not read this wicked book!" She had read it, and
"Wilhelm Meister," too (though in later life she
thought the latter "not altogether good reading for
the youth of our country"). Shelley was forbidden,
and Byron allowed only in small and carefully selected
doses.</p>

<p>The twofold bereavement which weighed so heavily
upon her checked for a time the development of her
thought, throwing her back on the ideas which her
childhood had received without question; but her buoyant
spirit could not remain long submerged, and as the
poignancy of grief abated, her mind sought eagerly for
clearer vision.</p>

<p>In the quiet of her own room, the bounds of thought
and of faith stretched wide and wider. Vision often
came in a flash: witness the moment when the question
of Matthias Claudius, "And is He not also
the God of the Japanese?" changed from a shocking
suggestion to an eternal truth. Witness also the moment
when, after reading "Paradise Lost," she saw
"the picture of an eternal evil, of Satan and his ministers
subjugated, indeed, by God, but not conquered,
and able to maintain against Him an opposition as
eternal as his goodness. This appeared to me impossible,
and I threw away, once and forever, the thought
of the terrible hell which till then had always formed
part of my belief. In its place I cherished the persuasion
that the victory of goodness must consist in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
everything good, and that Satan himself could
have no shield strong enough to resist permanently
the divine power of the divine spirit."</p>

<p>New vistas were opening everywhere before her.
She made acquaintance with Margaret Fuller, who
read her poems, and urged her to publish them. Of one
of these poems, Miss Fuller writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the record of days of genuine inspiration,&mdash;of
days when the soul lay in the light, when the spiritual
harmonies were clearly apprehended and great religious
symbols reanimated with their original meaning.
Its numbers have the fulness and sweetness of young
love, young life. Its gifts were great and demand the
service of a long day's work to <i>requite</i> and to interpret
them. I can hardly realize that the Julia Ward I have
seen has lived this life. It has not yet pervaded her
whole being, though I can recall something of it in the
steady light of her eye. May she become all attempered
and ennobled by this music. I saw in her taste,
the capacity for genius, and the utmost delicacy of
passionate feeling, but caught no glimpse at the time
of this higher mood.... If she publishes, I would not
have her omit the lines about the 'lonely room.' The
personal interest with which they stamp that part is
slight and delicate....</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">S. Margaret Fuller.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"I know of many persons in my own circle to whom
I think the poem would be especially grateful."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>On every hand she met people, who like herself were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
pressing forward, seeking new light. She heard Channing
preach, heard him say that God loves bad men
as well as good; another window opened in her soul.
Again, on a journey to Boston, she met Ralph Waldo
Emerson. The train being delayed at a wayside station,
she saw the Transcendentalist, whom she had
pictured as hardly human, carrying on his shoulder the
child of a poor and weary woman; her heart warmed
to him, and they soon made acquaintance. She, with
the ardor of youth, gave him at some length the religious
views which she still held in the main, and with
which she felt he would not agree. She enlarged upon
the personal presence of Satan on this earth, on his
power over man. Mr. Emerson replied with gentle
courtesy, "Surely the Angel must be stronger than the
Demon!" She never forgot these words; another window
opened, and a wide one.</p>

<p>Julia Ward had come a long way from old Ascension
Church, where Peter Stuyvesant, in a full brown wig,
carried round the plate, and the Reverend Manton
(afterwards Bishop) Eastburn preached sermons "remarked
for their good English"; and where communicants
were not expected to go to balls or theatres.</p>

<p>The years of mourning over, the Ward sisters took
up the pursuits natural to their age and position.
Louisa was now eighteen, very beautiful, already showing
the rare social gift which distinguished her through
life. The two sisters began a season of visiting, dancing,
and all manner of gayeties.</p>

<p>The following letter illustrates this period of her
girlhood:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span><i>To her sisters</i></p>

<blockquote>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Boston</span> (1842).<br />
Friday, that's all I know about to-day.<br />
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Chicks</span>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Though I have a right to be tired, having talked
and danced for the two last nights, yet my enjoyment
is most imperfect until I have shared it with you,
so I must needs write to you, and tell you what a
very nice time I am having. Last night I went to
a party at Miss Shaw's, given to <i>Boz and me</i>, at
least, I was invited before he came here, so think
that I will only give him an equal share of the
honor. I danced a good deal, with some very agreeable
partners, and talked as usual with Sumner, Hillard,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Longo,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> etc. I was quite pleased that Boz recognized
Fanny Appleton and myself, and gave us a smile and
bow <i>en passant</i>. He could do no more, being almost
torn to pieces by the crowd which throngs his footsteps,
wherever he goes. I like to look at him, he has
a bright and most speaking countenance, and his face
is all wrinkled with the lines, not of care, but of laughter.
His manners are very free and cordial, and he
seems to be as capital a fellow as one would suppose
from his writings. He circulates as universally as small
change, and understands the art of gratifying others
without troubling himself, of letting himself be seen
without displaying himself&mdash;now this speaks for his
real good taste, and shows that if not a gentleman born
and bred, he is at least a man, every inch of him.</p>

<p>... I have had hardly the least dash of Transcendentalism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and that of the very best description, a lecture
and a visit from Emerson, in both of which he said
beautiful things, and to-morrow (don't be shocked!)
a conversation at Miss Fuller's, which I shall treasure
up for your amusement and instruction. I have also
heard (don't go into hysterics!) Dr. Channing once. It
was a rare chance, as he does not now preach once in a
year. His discourse was very beautiful&mdash;and oh, such a
sermon as I heard from Father Taylor! I was almost
disposed to say, "surely never man spake like this
man." And now good-bye. I must shut up the budget,
and keep some for a rainy day. God bless my darling
sisters. Love to dear Sam and Uncle. Your</p>

<p><br />In these days also she first met her future husband.</p>

<p>Samuel Gridley Howe was at this time (1842) forty-one
years of age; his life had been a stirring and adventurous
one. After passing through Brown University,
and the Harvard Medical School, in 1824 he threw
in his lot with the people of Greece, then engaged in
their War of Independence, and for six years shared
their labor and hardships in the field, and on shipboard,
being surgeon-in-chief first to the Greek army, then to
the fleet. It was noted by a companion in arms, that
"the only fault found with him was that he always
would be in the fight, and was only a surgeon when the
battle was over." He eventually found, however, that
his work was to be constructive, not destructive.</p>

<p>The people were perishing for lack of food; he returned
to America, preached a crusade, and took back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to Greece a shipload of food and clothing for the starving
women and children. Having fed them, he set them
to work; built a hospital and a mole (which stands to
this day in Ægina), founded a colony, and turned
the half-naked peasants into farmers. These matters
have been fully related elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Returning to this country in 1831, he took up the
education of the blind, which was to be chief among
the multifarious labors of his life.</p>

<p>When Julia Ward first met him, he had been for nine
years Director of the Perkins Institution for the Blind,
and was known throughout the civilized world as the
man who had first taught language to a blind deaf
mute (Laura Bridgman).</p>

<p>Up to this time a person thus afflicted was classed
with idiots, "because," as Blackstone says, "his mind
cannot be reached." This dictum had been recently reaffirmed
by a body of learned men. Dr. Howe thought
otherwise. Briefly, he invented a new science. "He
carefully reasoned out every step of the way, and made
a full and clear record of the methods which he invented,
not for his pupils alone, but for the whole
afflicted class for which he opened the way to human
fellowship.... His methods have been employed in
all subsequent cases, and after seventy years of trial
remain the standard."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Hand in hand with Dorothea Dix, he was beginning
the great fight for helping and uplifting the insane;
was already, with Horace Mann, considering the condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of the common schools, and forging the weapons
for other fights which laid the foundations of the school
system of Massachusetts. Later, he was to take up
the cause of the feeble-minded, the deaf mute, the prisoner,
the slave; throughout his life, no one in "trouble,
sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity" was
ever to call on him in vain.</p>

<p>His friends called him the "Chevalier"; partly because
the King of Greece had made him a Knight of
St. George, but more because they saw in him a good
knight without fear and without reproach. Charles
Sumner was his <i>alter ego</i>, the brother of his heart; others
of his intimates at that time were Longfellow, George
Hillard, Cornelius Felton, Henry Cleveland. This
little knot of friends called themselves "The Five of
Clubs," and met often to make merry and to discuss
the things of life.</p>

<p>The summer of 1842 was spent by Julia Ward and
her sisters at a cottage in the neighborhood of Boston,
in company with their friend Mary Ward.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Here
Longfellow and Sumner often visited them, and here
Julia first heard of the Chevalier and his wonderful
achievement in educating Laura Bridgman. Deeply
interested, she gladly accepted the offer of the two
friends to drive her and her sisters over to the Perkins
Institution. She has described how "Mr. Sumner,
looking out of a window, said, 'Oh! here comes Howe
on his black horse.' I looked out also, and beheld a
noble rider on a noble steed."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<p>The slender, military figure, the jet-black hair, keen
blue eyes, and brilliant complexion, above all the vivid
presence, like the flash of a sword&mdash;all these could
not fail to impress the young girl deeply; the Chevalier,
on his part, saw and recognized the <i>Diva Julia</i> of his
friends' description. She has told us "how acquaintance
ripened into good-will" between the two.</p>

<p>The Chevalier, eager to push the acquaintance further,
went to New York to call on the Diva and her
family. In a private journal of the time we find the
following glimpse of the pair:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Walked down Broadway with all the fashion and
met the pretty blue-stocking, Miss Julia Ward, with
her admirer, Dr. Howe, just home from Europe. She
had on a blue satin cloak and a white muslin dress. I
looked to see if she had on blue stockings, but I think
not. I suspect that her stockings were pink, and she
wore low slippers, as Grandmamma does. They say
she dreams in Italian and quotes French verses. She
sang very prettily at a party last evening, and accompanied
herself on the piano. I noticed how white her
hands were."</p>

<p>During a subsequent visit to Boston in the winter
of 1842-43, Julia Ward and Dr. Howe became engaged.
The engagement was warmly welcomed by the
friends of both.</p>

<p>Charles Sumner writes to Julia:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Howe has told me, with eyes flashing with joy, that
you have received his love. May God make you happy
in his heart, as I know he will be happy in yours! A
truer heart was never offered to woman. I know him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
well. I know the depth, strength, and constancy of his
affections, as the whole world knows the beauty of his
life and character. And oh! how I rejoice that these are
all to mingle in loving harmony with your great gifts of
heart and mind. God bless you! God bless you both!
You will strengthen each other for the duties of life;
and the most beautiful happiness shall be yours&mdash;that
derived from inextinguishable mutual love, and
from the consciousness of duty done.</p>

<p>"You have accepted my dear Howe as your lover;
pray let me ever be</p>

<div class="signature">
"Your most affectionate friend,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.
</div>

<p>"P.S. Sir Huldbrand has subdued the restless
Undine, and the soul has been inspired into her; and
her 'wickedness' shall cease."</p></blockquote>


<p>Longfellow's letter to Dr. Howe also has been preserved
among the precious relics of the time.</p>


<blockquote><p>
<span class="smcap">My dearest Chevalier</span>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>From the deepest dungeons of my heart, all the
imprisoned sympathies and affections of my nature
cry aloud to you, saying "All hail!" On my return
from Portland this afternoon, I found your note,
and before reading it I read in Sumner's eyes your
happiness. The great riddle of life is no longer a
riddle to you; the great mystery is solved. I need
not say to you how very deeply and devoutly I rejoice
with you; and no one more so, I assure you.
Among all your friends, I am the oldest friend of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
fair young bride; she is a beautiful spirit, a truth, which
friendship has learned by heart in a few years. Love
has taught you in as many hours!</p>

<p>Of course you seem to be transfigured and glorified.
You walk above in the June air, while Sumner and I,
like the poor (sprites) in "Faust," who were struggling
far down in the cracks and fissures of the rocks, cry
out to you, "O take us with you! take us with you!"</p>

<p>In fine, my dear Doctor, God bless you and yours.
You know already how much I approve your choice.
I went to your office this afternoon to tell you with
my own lips; but you were not there. Take, therefore,
this brief expression of my happiness at knowing you
are so happy; and believe me</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>At the same time Diva writes to her brother Sam:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Chevalier says truly&mdash;I am the captive of
his bow and spear. His true devotion has won me from
the world, and from myself. The past is already fading
from my sight; already, I begin to live with him in the
future, which shall be as calmly bright as true love can
make it. I am perfectly satisfied to sacrifice to one so
noble and earnest the day dreams of my youth. He will
make life more beautiful to me than a dream....</p>

<p>"The Chevalier is very presumptuous&mdash;says that
he will not lose sight of me for one day, that I must stay
here till he can return with me to New York. The
Chevalier is very impertinent, speaks of two or three
months, when I speak of two or three years, and seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
determined to have his own way: but, dear Bunny, the
Chevalier's way will be a very charming way, and is,
henceforth, to be mine."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was not to be supposed that the Chevalier would
wait longer for his bride than was absolutely necessary.
The wedding preparations were hurried on, most
of them being made by Sisters Annie and Louisa, as
Julia could not be brought down from the clouds sufficiently
to give them much attention. It was hard
even to make her choose her wedding dress; but this
was finally decided upon, "a white embroidered muslin,
exquisitely fine, to be worn over a satin 'slip.'"</p>

<p>The wedding, a quiet one, took place at Samuel
Ward's house, on April 23, 1843, and four days later,
Chevalier and Diva sailed together for Europe.</p>

<p>In the forties it was no uncommon thing for a sister
or friend of the bride to form one of the wedding party
when a journey was to be taken; accordingly Annie
Ward went with the Howes and shared the pleasures of
a notable year. She was at this time seventeen; it was
said of her that "she looked so like a lily-of-the-valley
that one expected to see two long green leaves spring
up beside her as she walked."</p>

<p>Horace Mann and his bride (Mary Peabody, sister
of Mrs. Nathaniel Hawthorne) sailed on the same
steamer; the friends met afterward in London and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The first days at sea were rough and uncomfortable.
Julia writes to her sister Louisa:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have had two days of extreme suffering, and look
like the Chevalier's grandmother. To-day I am on
deck, able to eat soup and herring, with grog in small
doses. Husband very kind, takes good care of me. I
am good for nothing, but try to be courageous. Mr.

night, I was so ill; I slept all the time, and forgot that
Annie was on board.... When you do get married,
don't leave in four days for Europe.... Don't forget
cake for my orphans.... Mrs. Mann wrote to me
yesterday, and recommended lemonade. I wrote back
to her, and recommended leeks and onions...."</p></blockquote>

<p>And again, several days later:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Although the ship is very tipsy, and makes my
head and hand unsteady, I am anxious to write to you
that you may see what a brave sailor I am become, for
to write at sea one must be quite well. I am ashamed
to have written you so sea-sick a letter near Halifax,
but I was then just out of my berth, and very miserable.
Since that time, I have not once laid by&mdash;we
have had some rough days, but I have always held up
my head, and eaten my dinner, 'helping myself <i>sang-froidy</i>'
to all manner of good things. At first, I could
not do without brandy and water, but in a little while
I ceased to require it; now I go tumbling about all over
the ship, singing at the top of my voice, teasing Chevalier,
and comforting the sea-sick.... I live on deck,
rain or shine. Annie stays too much in the cabin,
which is strewn with sick ladies, and grannies of the
other sex, and which ever resounds with cries of 'Mrs.
Bean! Mrs. Bean! soda water! Mrs. Bean, soup! Mrs.
Bean, gruel with brandy in it! Mrs. Bean, hold my
head! Mrs. Bean, wag my jaws!' Mrs. Bean is the
stewardess, and an angel....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>"<i>Saturday morning.</i> We are now in sight of land,
and in smooth water.... Annie and I were getting
very much used to the ship, and are just in fine trim
for a long voyage. I even miss the rolling and pitching
which we have had until to-day, and which made it necessary
to walk with great circumspection. You would
have laughed to have seen us, going about like tipsy
witches. I have had various tumbles. I confess that
when the ship rolled and I felt myself going, I generally
made for the stoutest man in sight, and pitched into
him, the result being various apologies on both sides,
and great merriment on the part of the spectators&mdash;a
little of the old mischief left, you see. The old cow began
to smell the land yesterday, she reared and bellowed,
and butted at the butcher when he went to
milk her. This is her third voyage. I cannot tell you
how good my husband is, how kind, how devoted...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Arriving in London, they took lodgings in upper
Baker Street.</p>

<p>This first visit to London was one which our mother
always loved to recall. Not only had the pair brought
letters to many notabilities, but Dr. Howe's reputation
had preceded him, and every reader of Dickens's
"American Notes" was eager to meet the man who
had brought a soul out of prison.</p>

<p>Julia writes to her sister Louisa (June 17):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have said something,&mdash;I can hardly say enough,
of the kindness we have received here. London seems
already a home to us, and one surrounded by dear
friends. Morpeth and his family, Rogers, Basil Montagu,
and Sir R. H. Inglis have been our best friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Sydney Smith also has been kind to us; he calls Howe
'Prometheus,' and says that he gave a soul to an
inanimate body. For four mornings, we have not once
breakfasted at home. Milnes gave us one very nice
breakfast; among the guests was Charles Buller, celebrated
here for his wit and various endowments. The
two handsomest women I have seen are Mrs. Norton
and the Duchess of Sutherland&mdash;the former of these
rather a haughty beauty, with flashing eye and swelling
lip, and dress too low for our notions of propriety&mdash;this
is common enough here...."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Doctor was lame (the result of an accident on
shipboard), and the Reverend Sydney Smith, one of
their earliest visitors, insisted on lending him his own
crutches. The Doctor demurred; he was tall, while
Canon Smith was short and stout. The crutches were
sent, nevertheless. They could not be used, and were
returned with thanks; not so soon, however, but that
the kind and witty Canon made of the incident a peg
on which to hang a jest. He had lost money by American
investments; in a letter published in a London
paper, after reflecting severely upon the failure of some
of the Western States to pay their debts, he added:
"And now an American doctor has deprived me of my
last means of support!"</p>

<p>Sydney Smith proved genuinely kind and solicitous.
He writes to the Doctor:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"You know as well as I do, or better, that nature
charges one hundred per cent for a bad leg used before
the proper time, and that if you use it a day sooner
than you ought, it may molest you for a month longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
than you expect. This being; [<i>sic</i>] if your ladies will
trust themselves to me any day, I shall have great pleasure
in escorting them in their sight-seeing, and will call
upon them with my carriage, if that be possible."</p></blockquote>

<p>He did take them about a great deal; they dined with
him, and passed more than one delightful evening at
his house.</p>

<p>Another of their early visitors was Charles Dickens.
Not only did he invite them to dine, but he took them
to all manner of places unfamiliar to the ordinary tourist:
to prisons, workhouses, and asylums, more interesting
to the Chevalier than theatre or picture-gallery.</p>

<p>There were even expeditions to darker places, when
Julia and Annie must stay at home. Dr. Howe's affair
was with all sorts and conditions of men, and the
creator of Joe and Oliver Twist, the child of the Marshalsea,
could show him things that no one else could.
The following note, in Dickens's unmistakable handwriting,
shows how these expeditions were managed,
and how he enjoyed them:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Howe</span>,&mdash;Drive to-night to St. Giles's
Church. Be there at half-past 11&mdash;and wait. One
of Tracey's people will put his head into the coach after
a Venetian and mysterious fashion, and breathe your
name. Follow that man. Trust him to the death.</p>

<p>So no more at present from</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">The Mask</span>.
</div>
<p>Ninth June, 1843.<br /><br />
</p></blockquote>


<p>Horace Mann was of the party on most of these
investigations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>Beside dinners and evening parties, there were breakfasts,
with Richard Monckton Milnes (afterward Lord
Houghton), with Samuel Rogers,&mdash;who gave them
plovers' eggs,&mdash;and with jovial Sir Robert Harry Inglis,
who cut the loaf at either end, giving the guests "a
slice or a hunch" at their desire.</p>

<p>This meal, our mother notes, was not "a luncheon
in disguise," but a genuine breakfast, at ten or even
half-past nine o'clock.</p>

<p>She writes to her sister Louisa:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"People have been very kind to us&mdash;we have one
or two engagements for every day this week, and had
three dinners for one day, two of which we were, of
course, forced to decline. We had a pleasant dinner at
Dickens's, on Saturday&mdash;a very handsome entertainment,
consisting of all manner of good things. Dickens
led me in to dinner&mdash;waxed quite genial over his wine,
and was more natural than I ever saw him&mdash;after
dinner we had coffee, conversation and music, to which
I lent my little wee voice! We did not get home until
half-past eleven.... Annie has doubtless told you
how we went to see Carlyle, and Mrs. was out, and I
poured tea for him, and he handed me the preserves
with: 'I do not know what thae little things are, perhaps
you can eat them&mdash;I never touch them mysel'.'
This naturally made me laugh&mdash;we had a strange but
pleasant evening with him&mdash;he is about forty, looks
young for that, drinks powerful tea, and then goes it
strong upon all subjects, but without extravagance&mdash;he
has a fine head, an earnest face, a glowing eye....
Furthermore, we have walked into the affections of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Hon. Basil Montagu, and Mrs. Basil&mdash;furthermore,
Annie and I did went alone to a rout at Mrs. Sydney
Smith's, and were announced, 'Mrs. 'Owe hand Miss
Vord'&mdash;did not know a soul, Annie frightened, I
bored&mdash;got hold of some good people&mdash;made friends,
drank execrable tea, finished the evening by a crack
with Sir Sydney himself, and came off victorious, that
is to say alive. Sir S. very like old Mrs. Prime, three
chins, and such a corporosity!...</p>

<p>"<i>Saturday, June 2nd.</i> We have been too busy to
write. We dined on Wednesday with Kenyon&mdash;present
Dickens's wife, Fellows, Milnes and some others&mdash;Milnes
a pert little prig, but pleasant. <i>À propos</i>, when
he came to call upon us, our girl announced him as 'Mr.
Miller'&mdash;our conversation ran upon literature, and I
had the exquisite discrimination to tell him that except
Wordsworth, there were no great poets in England now.
Fortunately he soon took his departure, and thus prevented
me from expressing the light estimation in
which I hold his poetry. On Thursday Morpeth gave
us a beautiful dinner&mdash;thirteen servants in the hall,
powdered heads, Lady Carlisle very like Morpeth&mdash;Lady
Mary Howard not pretty; Duchess of Sutherland,
beautiful, but like Lizzie Hogg. They gave us strawberries,
the first we have tasted, green peas, pines,
peaches, apricots, grapes&mdash;all very expensive. We
stayed until nearly twelve&mdash;they were very gracious&mdash;Annie
and I are little people here&mdash;we are too
young(?) to be noticed&mdash;we are very demure, and
have learned humility. Chev receives a great deal of
attention, ladies press forward to look at him, roll up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
their eyes, and exclaim, 'Oh! he is such a wonner!' I do
not like that the pretty women should pay him so many
compliments&mdash;it will turn his little head! He is now
almost well, and so handsome! the wrinkles are almost
gone&mdash;Yesterday, Sir Robert Inglis gin us a treat
in the shape of a breakfast&mdash;it was very pleasant,
albeit Sir R. is very pious, and a Tory to boot. We
had afterward a charming visit from Carlyle&mdash;in the
evening we went to Landsdowne House, to a concert
given by the Marquis&mdash;heard Grisi, Lablache, Mario,
Standigl, were much pleased&mdash;I was astonished,
though, to find that our little trio at home was not
bad, even in comparison with these stars. They have,
of course, infinitely better voices, but hang me if they
sing with half the enthusiasm and fire of our old Sam
and Cousi, or even of poor Dudy. Grisi's voice is beautifully
clear and flute-like&mdash;Mario sings <i>si-be-mol</i> and
natural with perfect ease. I was most interested in the
German Standigl, who sang the '<i>Wanderer</i>' with
wonderful pathos. Lablache thundered away&mdash;I
must see them on the stage before I shall be able to
judge of them. After music we had supper. Willie
Wad<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> was indefatigable in our service. 'Go, and bring
us a great deal more lemonade!' these were our oft-repeated
orders, and the good Geneseo trotted to the
table for us, till, as he expressed it, 'he was ashamed
to go any more.' Lansdowne is a devilish good fellow!
ho! ho! He wears a blue belt across his diaphragm,
and a silver star on his left breast&mdash;he jigs up and
down the room, and makes himself at home in his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
house. He is about sixty, with Marchioness to match;
side dishes, I presume, but did not inquire. I have just
been breakfasting at the Duke of Sutherland's superb
palace. I will tell you next time about it. Lady Carlisle
says I am nice and pretty, oh! how I love her!..."</p></blockquote>

<p>In another letter she says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I take some interest in everything I see&mdash;especially
in all that throws light upon human prog. The Everetts<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
have given us a beautiful and most agreeable
dinner: Dickens, Mrs. Norton, Moore, Landseer, and
one or two others. Rogers says: 'I have three pleasures
in the day: the first is, when I get up in the morning,
and scratch myself with my hair mittens; the second
is when I dress for dinner, and scratch myself with my
hair mittens; the third is when I undress at night,
and scratch myself with my hair mittens.'..."</p></blockquote>

<p>Beside this feast of hospitality, there was the theatre,
with Macready and Helen Faucit in the "Lady of
Lyons," and the opera, with Grisi and Mario, Alboni
and Persiani. Julia, who had been forbidden the theatre
since her seventh year, enjoyed to the full both
music and drama, but "the crowning ecstasy of all"
she found in the ballet, of which Fanny Elssler and
Cerito were the stars. The former was beginning to
wane; the dancing which to Emerson and Margaret
Fuller seemed "poetry and religion" had lost, perhaps,
something of its magic; the latter was still in her early
bloom and grace.</p>

<p>Years later, our mother suggested to Theodore Parker
that "the best stage dancing gives the <i>classic, in a
fluent form</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> with the illumination of life and personality."
She recalled nothing sensual or even sensuous
in the dances she saw that season, only "the very
ecstasy and embodiment of grace." (But the Doctor
thought Cerito ought to be sent to the House of Correction!)</p>

<p>Among the English friends, the one to whom our
parents became most warmly attached was Lord
Morpeth, afterwards Earl of Carlisle. This gentleman
proved a devoted friend. Not only did he show the
travellers every possible attention in London, but
finding that they were planning a tour through Wales,
Ireland, and Scotland, he made out with great care
an itinerary for them, giving the roads by which they
should travel and the points of interest they should
visit.</p>

<p>Very reluctantly they left the London of so many
delights, and started on the prescribed tour, following
in the main the lines laid down by their kind friend.</p>


<p class="center"><i>To her sister Louisa</i></p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
Sunday, July 2.
</div>

<p>... We are in Dublin, among the Paddies, and
funny enough they are. There are many beggars&mdash;you
cannot get into the carriage without being surrounded
with ragged women holding out their dirty
hands, and clamouring for ha'pence&mdash;we have just
returned from Edgeworthtown; on our way, we
walked into some of the peasants' huts. I will tell you
about one&mdash;it was thatched, built very miserably,
had no floor except the native mud; there was a peat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
fire, which filled the house with smoke&mdash;before the
fire lay the pig, grunting in concert with the chickens,
who were picking up scraps of the dinner, which consisted
of potatoes and salt&mdash;three families live in it.
Two sets of little ragamuffins are sitting in the dirt.
Ch. bestows some pence: "God kape your honour&mdash;God
save ye, wherever ye go, and sure and it's a nice,
comfortable looking young woman you have got with
you, an uncommon pretty girl" (that is me). Don't
they understand the matter, eh? We passed three
delightful hours with Miss Edgeworth, in the library
in which she wrote all her works&mdash;she was surrounded
by a numerous and charming family, among others,
the last of her father's four wives, whom she calls
mother, although the lady must be some ten years her
junior. She is herself a most vivacious little lady, about
seventy-five years old, but gay and bright as a young
girl&mdash;she seemed quite delighted with Ch., and conversed
with him on many topics in a very animated
manner. She has very clear and sound views of things,
and takes the liveliest interest in all that goes on
around her, and in the world. One of her younger
brothers (with a nice Spanish wife) has a nest of very
young children, in whom she delights as much as if she
had not helped to bring up three sets of brothers and
sisters. She said to me: "It is not only for Laura Bridgman
that I wanted to see Dr. Howe, but I admire the
spirit of all his writings." She gave him some engravings,
and wrote her name at the bottom.... At one
o'clock, we went to luncheon which was very nice,
consisting of meat, potatoes, and preserves.... She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
made us laugh, and laughed herself. They were saying
that American lard was quite superseding whale oil.
"Yes," said she, "and in consequence, the whale cannot
bear the sight of a pig." Her little nephew made a
real bull. He was showing me his rat trap, "and," said
he, "I shall kill the rat before I let him out, eh?"...</p>

<p><i>Dublin, Tuesday.</i> Went to the Repeal meeting at
the Corn Exchange. It was held in a small room in the
third or fourth story. "A shilling, sir," said the man
at the door to my husband.&mdash;"What!" replied he,
"do ladies pay?"&mdash;"Not unless they'd like to become
repealers." We passed up&mdash;the gentlemen went on
to the floor of the room&mdash;we went to the ladies' gallery,
a close confined place at one end&mdash;we were early,
and had good seats, for a time at least&mdash;we separated,
not anticipating the trouble we should have in finding
each other again&mdash;for the ladies, comprising orangewomen,
washerwomen, and I fear, all manner of women,
poured in, without much regard to order, decency,
and the rights of prior possession&mdash;and when O'Connell
came in, which was in about three quarters of an
hour, they pressed, and pushed, and squeezed, and
scolded, as only Irishwomen can do....The current
of female patriotism bore down upon me in a most
painful manner&mdash;a sort of triangular pressure seemed
applied to my poor body which threatened to destroy,
not only my centre of gravity, but my very personal
identity. I was obliged, I regret to say, to defend myself
as I have sometimes done in a quadrille or waltzing
circle in New York&mdash;I was forced to push in my
turn, though as moderately as I could. This was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
my only trouble&mdash;in the crowd, I had scraped acquaintance
with a respectable Irishwoman, who, after
various questions, discovered that I was an American,
and imagined me at once to be a good Catholic and
repealer&mdash;so when O'Connell made some allusions to
the Americans, she said so as to be heard by several
people, who immediately began to look at me with
curious eyes&mdash;"You shouldn't disturb her, she's an
American," and they would for a time cease to molest
me....O'Connell was not great on this occasion&mdash;his
remarks were rambling and superficial, distinguished
chiefly by their familiarity, and by the extreme
ingenuity with which the cunning orator disguises the
tendencies of the sentiments he vindicates, and talks
treason, yet so that the law cannot lay a finger upon
him. He had begun his speech when Steele, a brother
repealer, entered. He stopped at once, held out his
hand to him, saying in a loud tone, "Tom Steele, how
d'ye do?" which drew forth bursts of applause. "And
is he a good man?" I asked of a lady repealer (whether
apple-woman or seller of ginger beer, I know not). "Oh,
Ma'am, he is the best <i>cratur</i>, the most charitable, the
most virtuous, the most religious man&mdash;sure, he goes
to the communion every Sunday, and never says no
to no one."</p></blockquote>


<p>The visit to Scotland was all too hasty, the notes
are mere brief jottings; at the end she "remembered
but one thing, the grave of Scott. In return for all the
delight he had given me, I had nothing to give him but
my silent tears."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>The end of July found the party once more in England.
The following letter tells of the unlucky visit
to Wordsworth which our mother (after forty-six
years) describes from memory in her "Reminiscences"
in slightly different terms.</p>


<p class="center"><i>To her sister Louisa</i></p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
July 29.<br />
</div>

<p>... I am very glad to be out of Ireland and Scotland,
where we had incessant rains&mdash;even the beautiful
Loch Katrine would not show herself to us in sunshine.
We crossed in an open boat, and had a pony ride of
five miles, all in as abominable a drizzle as you would
wish to see. The Cumberland Lakes, among which
we sought the shrine of Wordsworth, were almost as
unaccommodating&mdash;in driving to Windermere we got
wetted to the skin, and dashed down the steep mountain
road in a thick mist, with a pair of horses, so unruly
that I supposed the miseries of wet garments would
soon be cancelled by that of a broken neck. I prayed
to Saint Crispin, Saint Nicholas, and the three kings
of Köln, and got through the danger&mdash;in the evening
we visited Wordsworth, a crabbed old sinner, who
gave us a very indifferent muffin, and talked repudiation
with Chev. As he had just lost a great deal of
money by Mississippi bonds, you may imagine that
he felt particularly disposed to be cordial to Americans&mdash;and
not knowing, probably, that New York is not
in the heart of Louisiana, he was inclined no doubt to
cast part of the odium upon us. Accordingly Mrs.
Wordsworth and her daughter sat at one end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
room, Annie and I at the other. Incensed at this unusual
neglect, I made several interjections in a low
tone for Annie's benefit (my husband allows me to
swear once a week)&mdash;at length, good Townsend-on-Mesmerism
came to my relief, and kindly talked with
me for an hour or more&mdash;he is a charming person,
and rides other people's horses as well as his own hobby.
He dislikes England, and lives principally in Germany.
Kind Heaven, at the termination of the evening, sent
me an opportunity of imparting a small portion of the
internal pepper and mustard which had been ripening
in my heart during the whole evening. The mother
and daughter beginning to whine to me about their
losses, I told them that where one Englishman had
suffered, twenty Americans were perhaps ruined. They
replied, it was hard they should suffer for the misfortunes
of another country. "And why," quoth I,
"must you needs speculate in foreign stocks? Why
did you not keep your money at home? It was safe
enough in England&mdash;you knew there was risk in investing
it so far from you&mdash;if we should speculate in
yours, we should no doubt be ruined also." This explosion,
from my meek self, took the company somewhat
by surprise&mdash;they held their tongues, and we
departed....</p></blockquote>


<p><br />From England the travellers had meant to go to Berlin,
but the King of Prussia, who eleven years before
had kept Dr. Howe in prison <i>au secret</i> for five weeks
for carrying (at the request of General Lafayette) succor
to certain Polish refugees, still regarded him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
dangerous person, and Prussia was closed to him and
his. This greatly amused Horace Mann, who wrote to
the Doctor, "I understand the King of Prussia has
about 200,000 men constantly under arms, and if necessary
he can increase his force to two millions. This
shows the estimation in which he holds your single
self!"</p>

<p>Years later, the King sent Dr. Howe a gold medal
in consideration of his work for the blind: by a singular
coincidence, its money value was found to equal
the sum which the Doctor had been forced to pay for
board and lodging in the prison of Berlin.</p>

<p>Making a détour, the party journeyed through Switzerland
and the Austrian Tyrol, spent some weeks in
Vienna, and a month in Milan, where they met Count
Gonfalonieri, one of the prisoners of Spielberg. Julia
had known two of these sufferers, Foresti and Albinola,
in New York, where they lived for many years,
beloved and respected. Hearing the talk of these men,
and seeing Italy bound hand and foot in temporal
and spiritual fetters, she was deeply impressed by the
apparent hopelessness of the outlook for the Italian
patriots. By what miracle, she asked herself long
afterward, was the great structure overthrown? She
adds, "The remembrance of this miracle forbids me
to despair of any great deliverance, desired and delayed.
He who maketh the wrath of men to serve
Him, can make liberty blossom out of the very rod
that the tyrant [wields]."</p>

<p>Southward still they journeyed, by <i>vettura</i>, in the
old leisurely fashion, and came at last to Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>The thrill of wonder that Julia felt at the first sight
of St. Peter's dome across the Campagna was one of
the abiding impressions of her life; Rome was to be one
of the cities of her heart; the charm was cast upon her
in that first moment. Yet she says of that Rome of
1843, "A great gloom and silence hung over it."</p>

<p>The houses were cold, and there were few conveniences;
but Christmas found the Howes established in
the Via San Niccolo da Tolentino, as comfortably as
might be. Here they were joined by Louisa Ward, and
here they soon gathered round them a delightful circle
of friends. Most of the <i>forestieri</i> of Rome in those days
were artists; among those who came often to the house
were Thomas Crawford, Luther Terry, Freeman the
painter and his wife, and Törmer, who painted a portrait
of Julia. The winter passed like a dream. There
were balls as gorgeous as those of London, with the
beautiful Princess Torlonia in place of the Duchess of
Sutherland; musical parties, at which Diva sang to the
admiration of all. There were visits to the galleries,
where George Combe was of the party, and where he
and the Chevalier studied the heads of statues and
busts from the point of view of phrenology, a theory
in which both were deeply interested. They were presented
to the Pope, Gregory XVI, who wished to hear
about Laura Bridgman. The Chevalier visited all the
"public institutions, misnamed charitable,"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and the
schools, whose masters were amazed to find that he
was an American, and asked how in that case it happened
that he was not black!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>In her "Reminiscences" our mother records many
vivid impressions of these Roman days. She had forgotten,
or did not care to recall, a certain languor and
depression of spirits which in some measure dimmed
for her the brightness of the picture, but which were
to give place to the highest joy she had yet known.
On March 12, her first child was born, and was christened
Julia Romana.</p>

<p>There are neither journals nor letters of this period;
the only record of it&mdash;from her hand&mdash;lies in two
slender manuscript books of verse, marked respectively
"1843" and "1844." In these volumes we trace her
movements, sometimes by the title of a poem, as "Sailing,"
"The Ladies of Llangollen," "The Roman Beggar
Boy," etc., sometimes by a single word written
after the poem, "Berne," "Milan."</p>

<p>From these poems we learn that she did not expect
to survive the birth of her child; yet with that birth
a new world opened before her.</p>

<p>
He gave the Mother's chastened heart,<br />
He gave the Mother's watchful eye,<br />
He bids me live but where thou art,<br />
And look with earnest prayer on high.<br /><br />
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />

Then spake the angel of Mothers<br />
To me in gentle tone:<br />
"Be kind to the children of others<br />
And thus deserve thine own!"<br />
</p>

<p>When, in the spring of 1844, she left Rome with husband,
sister, and baby, it seemed, she says, "like
returning to the living world after a long separation
from it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>Journeying by way of Naples, Marseilles, Avignon,
they came at length to Paris.</p>

<p>Here Julia first saw Rachel, and Taglioni, the greatest
of all dancers; here, too, she tried to persuade the
Chevalier to wear his Greek decorations to Guizot's
reception, but tried in vain, he considering such ornaments
unfitting a republican.</p>

<p>The autumn found them again in England, this
time to learn the delights of country visiting. Their
first visit was to Atherstone, the seat of Charles Nolte
Bracebridge, a descendant of Lady Godiva, a most
cultivated and delightful man. He and his charming
wife made the party welcome, and showed them everything
of interest except the family ghost, which remained
invisible.</p>

<p>Another interesting visit was to the Nightingales of
Embley. Florence Nightingale was at this time a young
woman of twenty-four. A warm friendship sprang up
between her and our parents, and she felt moved to
consult the Doctor on the matter which then chiefly
occupied her thoughts. Would it, she asked, be unsuitable
or unbecoming for a young Englishwoman to
devote herself to works of charity, in hospitals and elsewhere,
as the Catholic Sisters did?</p>

<p>The Doctor replied: "My dear Miss Florence, it
would be unusual, and in England whatever is unusual
is apt to be thought unsuitable; but I say to you, go
forward, if you have a vocation for that way of life;
act up to your inspiration, and you will find that there
is never anything unbecoming or unladylike in doing
your duty for the good of others. Choose your path,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
go on with it, wherever it may lead you, and God be
with you!"</p>

<p>Among the people they met in the autumn of 1844
was Professor Fowler, the phrenologist. This gentleman
examined Julia's head, and made the following
pronunciamento:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're a deep one! it takes a Yankee to find you
out. The intellectual temperament predominates in
your character. You will be a central character like
Henry Clay and Silas Wright, and people will group
themselves around you."</p>

<p>Now Julia could not abide Professor Fowler.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she snapped out angrily. "They've
always been my models!"</p>

<p>"The best things you do," he went on, "will be
done on the spur of the moment. You have enough
love of order to enjoy it, but you will not take the
trouble to produce it. You have more religion than
morality. You have genius, but no music in you by
nature."</p>

<p>Fifty years later these words were fresh in her
memory.</p>

<p>"I disliked Mr. Fowler extremely," she said, "and
believed nothing of what he said; nevertheless, most
of his predictions were verified. I had at the time no
leading in any of the directions he indicated. I had
been much shut up in personal and family life; was
a person rather of antipathies than sympathies. His
remarks made <i>no impression</i>. Yet," she added, "I
always had a sense of <i>relation to the public</i>, but thought
the connection would come through writing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>Apropos of Mr. Fowler's "more religion than morality,"
she said: "Morality is a thing of the will; we may
think differently of such matters at different times.
What he said may have been true."</p>

<p>Then the twinkle came into her eyes: "When Mr.
William Astor heard of my engagement, he said, 'Why,
Miss Julia, I am surprised! I thought you were too
intellectual to marry!'"</p>

<p>Another acquaintance of this autumn was the late
Arthur Mills, who was through life one of our parents'
most valued friends. He came to America with them;
in his honor, during the voyage, Julia composed
"The Milsiad," scribbling the lines day by day in a
little note-book, still carefully preserved in the Mills
family.</p>

<p>The first and last stanzas give an idea of this poem,
which, though never printed, was always a favorite
with its author.</p>

<p>
My heart fills<br />
With the bare thought of the illustrious Mills:<br />
That man of eyes and nose,<br />
Of legs and arms, of fingers and of toes.<br /><br />

*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />

To lands devoid of tax<br />
Goeth he not, armed with axe?<br />
Trees shall he cut down,<br />
And forests ever?<br />
Tame cataracts with a frown?<br />
Grin all the fish from Mississippi River?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(My style is grandiose,</span><br />

one of the most brilliant exploits of philanthropy, modern or ancient. Much
of the good that good men do soon passes out of the remembrance of busy

labor and interest. But it will be long before the world shall forget the courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>

<div class="signature">
J. W. H., <i>Memoir of Dr. Samuel G. Howe</i>.<br /><br />
</div></blockquote>


<p>In September, 1844, the travellers returned to America
and took up their residence at the Perkins Institution,
in South Boston, in the apartment known as the
"Doctor's Wing."</p>

<p>At first, Laura Bridgman made one of the family,
the Doctor considering her almost as an adopted child.
His marriage had been something of a shock to her.</p>

<p>"Does Doctor love me like Julia?" she asked her
teacher anxiously.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Does he love God like Julia?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>A pause: then&mdash;"God was kind to give him his
wife!"</p>

<p>She and Julia became much attached to each other,
and were friends through life.</p>

<p>Julia was now to realize fully the great change that
had come in her life. She had been the acknowledged
queen of her home and circle in New York. Up to this
time, she had known Boston as a gay visitor knows it.</p>

<p>She came now as the wife of a man who had neither
leisure nor inclination for "<i>Society</i>"; a man of tenderest
heart, but of dominant personality, accustomed to rule,
and devoted to causes of which she knew only by hearsay;
moreover, so absorbed in work for these causes,
that he could only enjoy his home by snatches.</p>

<p>She herself says: "The romance of charity easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
interests the public. Its laborious details and duties
repel and weary the many, and find fitting ministers
only in a few spirits of rare and untiring benevolence.
Dr. Howe, after all the laurels and roses of victory,
had to deal with the thorny ways of a profession tedious,
difficult, and exceptional. He was obliged to
create his own working machinery, to drill and instruct
his corps of teachers, himself first learning the secrets
of the desired instruction. He was also obliged to keep
the infant Institution fresh in the interest and goodwill
of the public, and to give it a place among the
recognized benefactions of the Commonwealth."</p>

<p>From the bright little world of old New York, from
relatives and friends, music and laughter, fun and frolic,
she came to live in an Institution, a bleak, lofty house
set on a hill, four-square to all the winds that blew;
with high-studded rooms, cold halls paved with white
and gray marble, echoing galleries; where three fourths
of the inmates were blind, and the remaining fourth
were devoting their time and energies to the blind.
The Institution was two miles from Boston, where the
friends of her girlhood lived: an unattractive district
stretched between, traversed once in two hours by
omnibuses, the only means of transport.</p>

<p>Again, her life had been singularly free from responsibility.
First her Aunt Francis, then her sister Louisa,
had "kept house" in Bond Street; Julia had been a
flower of the field, taking no thought for food or raiment;
her sisters chose and bought her clothes, had her
dresses made, and put them on her. Her studies, her
music, her dreams, her compositions&mdash;and, it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
be added, her suitors&mdash;made the world in which she
lived. Now, life in its most concrete forms pressed
upon her. The baby must be fed at regular intervals,
and she must feed it; there must be three meals a day,
and she must provide them; servants must be engaged,
trained, directed, and all this she must do. Her
thoughts soared heavenward; but now there was a
string attached to them, and they must be pulled down
to attend to the leg of mutton and the baby's cloak.</p>

<p>This is one side of the picture; the other is different,
indeed.</p>

<p>Her girlhood had been shut in by locks and bars of
Calvinistic piety; her friends and family were ready to
laugh, to weep, to pray with her; they were not ready
to think with her. It is true that surrounding this intimate
circle was a wider one, where her mind found
stimulus in certain directions. She studied German
with Dr. Cogswell; she read Dante with Felice Foresti,
the Italian patriot; French, Latin, music, she had them
all. Her mind expanded, but her spiritual growth dates
from her early visits to Boston.</p>

<p>These visits had not been given wholly to gayety,
even in the days when she wrote, after a ball: "I have
been through the burning, fiery furnace, and it is Sad-rake,
Me-sick, and Abed-no-go!" The friends she
made, both men and women, were people alive and
awake, seeking new light, and finding it on every hand.
Moreover, at her side was now one of the torch-bearers
of humanity, a spirit burning with a clear flame of fervor
and resolve, lighting the dark places of the earth.
Her mind, under the stimulus of these influences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
opened like a flower; she too became one of the seekers
for light, and in her turn one of the light-bringers.</p>

<p>Among the poems of her early married life, none
is more illuminating than the portrait of Dr. Howe,
which heads this chapter. The concluding stanza gives
a hint of the depression which accompanied her first
realization of the driving power of his life, of the white-hot
metal of his nature. She was caught up as it were
in the wake of a comet, and whirled into new and
strange orbits: what wonder that for a time she was
bewildered? She had no thought, when writing "The
Rough Sketch," that a later day was to find her soul
indeed matched with his, "in high resolve and hardihood":
that through her lips, as well as his, God was to
sound forth a trumpet that should never call retreat.</p>

<p>In her normal health she was a person of abounding
vitality, with a constitution of iron: as is common with
such temperaments, she felt a physical distaste to the
abnormal and defective. It required in those days all
the strength of her will to overcome her natural shrinking
from the blind and the other defectives with whom
she was often thrown. There is no clearer evidence of
the development of her nature than the contrast between
this mental attitude and the deep tenderness
which she felt in her later years for the blind. After
the Doctor's death, they became her cherished friends;
she could never do enough for them; with every year
her desire to visit the Perkins Institution, to talk with
the pupils, to give them all she had to give, grew
stronger and more lively.</p>

<p>Of the friends of this time, none had so deep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
lasting an influence over her as Theodore Parker, who
had long been a close friend of the Doctor's. She had
first heard of him in her girlhood, as an impious and
sacrilegious person, to be shunned by all good Christians.</p>

<p>In 1843 she met him in Rome, and found him "one
of the most sympathetic and delightful of men"; an
intimacy sprang up between the two families which
ended only with Parker's life. He baptized the baby
Julia; on returning to this country, she and the Doctor
went regularly to hear him preach. This she always
considered as among the great opportunities of her life.</p>

<p>"I cannot remember," she says, "that the interest
of his sermons ever varied for me. It was all one intense
delight....It was hard to go out from his presence,
all aglow with the enthusiasm which he felt and
inspired, and to hear him spoken of as a teacher of
irreligion, a pest to the community."</p>

<p>These were the days when it was possible for a minister
of a Christian church, hearing of Parker's dangerous
illness, to pray that God might remove him from
the earth. To her, it seemed that "truly, he talked
with God, and took us with him into the divine presence."</p>

<p>Parker could play as well as preach; she loved to
"make fun" with him. Witness her "Philosoph-Master
and Poet-Aster" in "Passion Flowers." Parker's
own powers of merrymaking appear in his Latin epitaph
on "the Doctor" (who survived him by many
years), which is printed in the "Letters and Journals
of Samuel Gridley Howe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>She used in later years to shake her head as she
recalled a naughty <i>mot</i> of hers apropos of Parker's
preaching: "I would rather," she said, "hear Theodore
Parker preach than go to the theatre; I would rather
go to the theatre than go to a party; I would rather go
to a party than stay at home!"</p>

<p>A letter to her sister Annie shows the trend of her
religious thought in these days.</p>


<blockquote><div class="signature">
Sunday evening, December 8, 1844.</div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Annie</span>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Do not let the Bishop or Uncle or any one frighten
you into any concessions&mdash;tell them, and all others
that, even if you agree with them in doctrine, you
think their notion of a religious life narrow, false, superficial.
You owe it to truth, to them, to yourself,
to say so. I think perfect and fearless frankness one
of our highest duties to <i>man</i> as well as to God. Only
see how one half the world pragmatically sets its foot
down, and says to the other half, "Be converted,
my opinion is truth! I must be right and you must
be wrong,"&mdash;while the other half timidly falters a reluctant
acquiescence, or scarce audible expression of
doubt, and continues troubled and afraid and discontented
with itself and others. Let me never think of
you as in this ignominious position, dear Annie. Do
not think that I misapprehend you. I know you do
not agree in doctrine with me, but I know too that you
do not feel that you can abandon your life and conscience
to the charge and guidance of such a man as
Eastburn, or as Uncle Ben. Do not, therefore, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
afraid of them, but let their censure be a very secondary
thing with you&mdash;while your life is the true expression
of your faith, whom can you fear? You are
accountable to man for the performance of the duties
which affect his welfare and well-being&mdash;for those
which concern your own soul, you are accountable to
God alone. A man, though with twenty surplices on
his back and twenty prayer books in his hand, can no
more condemn than he can save you.... There may
be a hell and a heaven, and it may be good for most
people, for you and me, too, if you choose to think that
it is so. But there is a virtue which rises above such
considerations&mdash;there are motives higher than personal
fear or hope&mdash;the love of good because it is good, because
it is God's and nature's law, because it is the
secret of the beautiful order of things, because they are
blessed by your virtuous deeds and pure thoughts&mdash;because
every holy, every noble deed, word, or thought
helps to build up the ruins of the world, and to elevate
our degraded humanity. Those who propose to you hell
and heaven as the great incentives to right, appeal
merely to your natural love of personal advantage&mdash;those
who hold up to you a God now frowning and indignant,
now gracious and benignant, appeal simply
to your natural cowardice, to your natural love of approbation.
Does one love God for one's own advantage?
One loves Him for His perfection, and if one
loves Him, one keeps His commandments. Abandon,
I pray you, the exploded formula of selfishness!...
I think one should be capable of loving virtue, were one
sure even that hell and not heaven would be its reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>The benedictions of the Sermon on the Mount are
very simple&mdash;no raptures, no ecstasies are promised.
Blessed are all that seek the good of others and the
knowledge of truth&mdash;blessed, simply that in so doing
they obey the law of God, imitate His character, and
coming nearer and nearer to Him shall find Him more
and more in their hearts. One word about Unitarians.
It is very wrong to say that they reject the Bible,
simply because they interpret it in a different manner
from the (so-called) orthodox, or that they reject
Christ, because they understand him in one way, and
you in another&mdash;while they emulate his wonderful
life, while they acknowledge his divine mission, and
the divine power of his words, why should they be
said to despise him?...</p></blockquote>


<p>During the years between 1843 and 1859, her life
was from time to time shadowed by the approach of a
great joy. Before the birth of each successive child
she was oppressed by a deep and persistent melancholy.
Present and future alike seemed dark to her;
she wept for herself, but still more for the hapless
infant which must come to birth in so sorrowful a
world. With the birth of the child the cloud lifted
and vanished. Sunshine and joy&mdash;and the baby&mdash;filled
the world; the mother sang, laughed, and made
merry.</p>

<p>In her letters to her sisters, and later in her journals,
both these moods are abundantly evident. At first,
these letters are full of the bustle of arrival and of
settling in the Institution.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>"I received the silver.... The soup-ladle is my delight,
and I could almost take the dear old coffee-pot
to bed with me.... But here is the most important
thing.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My tragedy is left behind!</span>... My house ...
in great confusion, carpets not down, curtains not up,
the devil to pay, and not a sofa to ask him to sit down
upon...."</p></blockquote>

<p>She now felt sadly the need of training in matters
which her girlhood had despised. (She could describe
every room in her father's house save one&mdash;the
kitchen!) The Doctor liked to give weekly dinners
to his intimates, "The Five of Clubs," and others.
These dinners were something of a nightmare to Julia,
even with the aid of Miss Catherine Beecher's cookbook.
She spent weeks in studying this volume and
trying her hand on its recipes. This was not what
her hand was made for; yet she learned to make puddings,
and was proud of her preserves.</p>

<p>Speaking of the dinner parties, she tells of one for
which she had taken special pains, and of which ice-cream,
not then the food of every day, was to form
the climax. The ice-cream did not come, and her pleasure
was spoiled; she found it next morning in a snowbank
outside the back door, where the messenger had
"dumped" it without word or comment. "I should
laugh at it now," she says, "but then I almost wept
over it."</p>

<p>Everything in the new life interested her, even the
most prosaic details. She writes to her sister Louisa:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Our house has been enlivened of late by two delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
visits. The first was from the soap-fat merchant,
who gave me thirty-four pounds of good soap for my
grease. I was quite beside myself with joy, capered
about in the most enthusiastic manner, and was going
to hug in turn the soap, the grease, and the man, had
I not remembered my future ambassadress-ship, and
reflected that it would not sound well in history. This
morning came the rag-man, who takes rags and gives
nice tin vessels in exchange.... Both of these were
clever transactions. Oh, if you had seen me stand by
the soap-fat man, and scrutinize minutely his weights
and measures, telling him again and again that it was
beautiful grease, and he must allow me a good price for
it&mdash;truly, I am a mother in Israel."</p></blockquote>


<p>Much as the Doctor loved the Perkins Institution,
he longed for a home of his own, and in the spring of
1845 he found a place entirely to his mind.</p>

<p>A few steps from the Institution was a plot of land,
facing the sun, sheltered from the north wind by the
last remaining bit of "Washington Heights," the eminence
on which Washington planted the batteries which
drove the British out of Boston. Some six acres of
fertile ground, an old house with low, broad, sunny
rooms, two towering Balm of Gilead trees, and some
ancient fruit trees: this was all in the beginning; but the
Doctor saw at a glance the possibilities of the place.
He bought it, added one or two rooms to the old house,
planted fruit trees, laid out flower gardens, and in the
summer of 1845 moved his little family thither.</p>

<p>The move was made on a lovely summer day. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
our mother drove into the green bower, half shade,
half sunshine, silent save for the birds, she cried out,
"Oh! this is green peace!" The name fitted and clung:
"<i>Green Peace</i>" was known and loved as such so long
as it existed.</p>

<p>This was the principal home of her married life, but
it was not precisely an abiding one. The summers were
spent elsewhere; moreover, the "Doctor's Wing" in
the Institution was always ready for habitation, and
it often happened that for one reason or another the
family were taken back there for weeks or months.
Two of the six children, Florence and Maud, were
born at the Institution; the former just before the move
to Green Peace. She was named Florence in honor
of Miss Nightingale. The Doctor had ardently desired
a son; finding the baby a girl, "I will forgive you," he
cried, "if you will name her for Florence Nightingale!"
Miss Nightingale became the child's godmother, sent
a golden cup (now a precious heirloom), and wrote as
follows:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Embley</span>, December 26.
</div>

<p>I cannot pretend to express, my dear kind friends,
how touched and pleased I was by such a remembrance
of me as that of your child's name.... If I could live
to justify your opinion of me, it would have been
enough to have lived for, and such thoughts, as that
of your goodness, are great thoughts, "strong to consume
small troubles" which should bear us up on the
wings of the Eagle, like Guido's Ganymede, up to the
feet of the God, there to take what work he has for us
to do for him. I shall hope to see my little Florence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>

<p>The children have been so very obliging as to go
to sleep, and having worried over them all day, and
part of the evening, I will endeavor to give you what
is left of it. When you become the mother of two
children you will understand the value of time as
you never understood it before. My days and nights
are pretty much divided between Julia and Florence.
I sleep with the baby, nurse her all night, get up,
hurry through my breakfast, take care of her while
Emily gets hers, then wash and dress her, put her to
sleep, drag her out in the wagon, amuse Dudie, kiss,
love and scold her, etc., etc.... Oh, my dear Wevie,
for one good squeeze in your loving arms, for one
kiss, and one smile from you, what would I not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
give? Anything, even my box of Paris finery, which
I have just opened, with great edification. Oh, what
headdresses! what silks! what a bonnet, what a mantelet!
I clapped my hands and cried glory for the
space of half an hour, then danced a few Polkas around
the study table, then sat down and felt happy, then
remembered that I had now nothing to do save to grow
old and ugly, and so turned a misanthropic look upon
the Marie Stuart garland, etc., etc. You have certainly
chosen my things with your own perfect taste. The
flowers and dresses are alike exquisite, and so are all
the things, not forgetting Dudie's little darling bonnet.
But I fear that even this beautiful toilette will hardly
tempt me from my nursery fireside where my presence
is, in these days, indispensable. I have not been ten
minutes this whole day, without holding one or other
of the children. I have to sit with Fo-fo on one knee
and Dudie on the other, trotting them alternately, and
singing, "Jim along Josie," till I can't Jim along any
further possibly. Well, life is peculiar anyhow. Dudie
doesn't go alone yet&mdash;heaven only knows when she
will. <i>Sunday evening.</i> I wore the new bonnet and mantelet
to church, to-day:&mdash;frightened the sexton, made
the minister squint, and the congregation stare. It
looked rather like a green clam shell, some folks thought.
I did not. I cocked it as high as ever I could, but somehow
it did plague me a little. I shall soon get used to
it. Sumner has been dining with us, and he and Chev
have been pitying unmarried women. Oh, my dear
friends, thought I, if you could only have one baby,
you would change your tune.... Heaven grant that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
your dear little child may arrive safely, and gladden
your heart with its sweet face. What a new world will
its birth open to you, an ocean of love unfathomed
even by your loving heart. I cannot tell you the comfort
I have in my little ones, troublesome as they
sometimes are. However weary I may be at night, it
is sweet to feel that I have devoted the day to them.
I am become quite an adept in washing and dressing,
and curl my little Fo-fo's hair beautifully. Tell Donald
that I can even wash out the little crease in her back,
without rubbing the skin off....</p></blockquote>

<p>My poor dear little Ante-nuptial, I will write to you,
and I will come to you, though I can do you no good&mdash;sentiment
and sympathy I have none, but such insipidity
as I have give I unto thee.... Dear Annie,
your marriage is to me a grave and solemn matter.
I hardly allow myself to think about it. God give you
all happiness, dearest child. Some sufferings and trials
I fear you must have, for after all, the entering into
single combat, hand to hand, with the realities of life,
will be strange and painful to one who has hitherto
lived, enjoyed, and suffered, <i>en l'air</i>, as you have done....
To be happily married seems to me the best thing
for a woman. Oh! my sweet Annie, may you be happy&mdash;your
maidenhood has been pure, sinless, loving,
beautiful&mdash;you have no remorses, no anxious thought
about the past. You have lived to make the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
more beautiful and bright&mdash;may your married life
be as holy and harmless&mdash;may it be more complete,
and more acceptable to God than your single life could
possibly have been. Marriage, like death, is a debt we
owe to nature, and though it costs us something to pay
it, yet are we more content and better <i>established</i> in
peace, when we have paid it. A young girl is a loose
flower or flower seed, blown about by the wind, it may
be cruelly battered, may be utterly blighted and lost to
this world, but the matron is the same flower or seed
planted, springing up and bearing fruit unto eternal
life. What a comfort would Wevie now be to you&mdash;she
is so much more <i>loving</i> than I, but thee knows I
try. I have been better lately, the quiet nights seem
to speak to me again, and to quicken my dead soul.
What I feel is a premature <i>old age</i>, caused by the strong
passions and conflicts of my early life. It is the languor
and indifference of old age, without its wisdom,
or its well-earned right to repose. Sweetie, wasn't the
bonnet letter hideous? I sent it that you might see
how <i>naughty I could be</i>....</p></blockquote>

<p>The Doctor's health had been affected by the hardships
and exposures of his service in the Greek Revolution,
and his arduous labors now gave him little time
for rest or recuperation. He was subject to agonizing
headaches, each of which was a brief but distressing
illness. In the summer of 1846 he resolved to try the
water cure, then considered by many a sovereign remedy
for all human ailments, and he and our mother
spent some delightful weeks at Brattleboro, Vermont.</p>

</p>

<p>... We left dear old Brattleboro on Sunday afternoon,
at five o'clock, serenely packed in our little carriage;
the good old boarding-house woman kissed me,
and presented me with a bundle, containing cake, biscuits,
and whortleberries.... Two calico bags, one big
and one little, contained our baggage for the journey.
Chev and I felt well and happy, the children were good,
the horses went like birds, and showed themselves
horses of good mettle, by carrying us over a distance
of one hundred miles in something less than two days,
for we arrived here at three o'clock to-day, so that the
second 24 hours was not completed. Very pleasant was
our little journey. We started very early each morning,
and went ten or twelve miles to becassim;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the
country inns were clean, quiet and funny. We had custards,
pickles, and pies for breakfast, and tea at dinner.
Oh, it was a good time! At Athol, I found a
piano, and sat down to sing negro songs for the children.
A charming audience, comprising cook, ostler,
and waiter, collected around the parlour door, and
encouraged me with a broom and a pitchfork. Well,
it was pleasant to arrive at our dear Green Peace,
or Villa Julia, as they call it. We found everything
in beautiful order, the green corn grown as high as
our heads, and ripe enough to eat, the turkey sitting
on eleven eggs, the peahen on four, six young turkeys
already growing up, and two broods of young chickens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Peas, tomatoes, beans, squashes and potatoes, all
flourishing. Our garden entirely supplies us with vegetables,
and we shall have many apples and pears. Immediately
upon my arrival, I found the box and little
parcel from you. You may imagine the pleasure it gave
me to receive, at this distance, things which your tasteful
little fingers had worked.... I am rather ashamed
to see how beautiful your work is, when mine is as
coarse as possible. In truth, I am a clumsy seamstress,
but I make good puddings, and the little things I make
do well enough here in the country.... <i>August 15th.</i>
I have passed eleven quiet and peaceful days since I
got so far with my letter. My chicks have been good,
and my husband well. My household affairs go on
very pleasantly and easily nowadays. My good stout
German girl takes care of the chicks and helps a little
with the chamber work. My little Lizzie does the cooking,
all but the puddings which I always make myself,
so I keep but two house servants. The man takes care
of the horses, drives and keeps the garden in excellent
order. I make my bed and put my room in order as
well as I can. I generally wipe the dishes when Lizzie
has washed them, so you see that I am quite an industrious
flea. I have made very nice raspberry jam and
currant jelly with my own hands.... Felton came to
tea last evening. He was pleasant and bright. He will
be married some time in November. Hillard, too, has
been to see me. Yesterday was made famous by the
purchase of a very beautiful piano of Chickering's
manufacture. The value of it was $450, but the kind
Chick sold it to us at wholesale price. It arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Green Peace to-day, and has already gladdened the
children's hearts by some gay tunes, the rags of my
antiquated musical repertory. You will be glad, I am
sure, to know that I have one at last, for I have been
many months without any instrument, so that I have
almost forgotten how to touch one.... My mourning
[for a sister-in-law] has been quite an inconvenience
to me, this summer. I had just spent all the money
I could afford for my summer clothes, and was forced
to spend $30 more for black dresses.... The black
clothes, however, seem to me very idle things, and I
shall leave word in my will that no one shall wear them
for me....</p></blockquote>

me, to return to life and to feel that I have any sympathy

enjoyments as I do, above <i>almost</i> everything else in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
world? God forgive me if I do wrong in following with
ardor the strongest instincts of my nature, but I have
been doing wrong all my life, in some way or other. I
have been giving a succession of little musical parties
on Saturday evenings, and I assure you they have been
quite successful. I have to be sure only my little parlour
in the Winthrop House, but even that is larger
than the grand saloon at S. Niccolo da Tolentino
which managed to hold so much fun on Friday evenings.
I have found some musical friends to sing with
me&mdash;Lizzie Cary, Mrs. Felton, Mr. Pelosos and William
Story, of whom more anon.... Agassiz, the
learned and charming Frenchman, is also one of my
<i>habitués</i> on Saturday evenings, and Count Pourtalés, a
Swiss nobleman of good family, who has accompanied
Agassiz to this country! I illuminate my room with a
chandelier and some candles, draw out the piano into
the room, and order some ice from Mrs. Mayer's&mdash;so
that the reception gives me very little trouble. My
friends come at half-past eight and stay until eleven.
I do not usually have more than twenty people, but
once I have had nearly sixty, and those of the best
people in Boston. Chev is very desirous of having a
house in town, and is far more pleased with my success

<p>... I have not written because I have been in a studious,
meditative, and most uncommunicative frame of
mind, and have very few words to throw at many dogs.
It is quite delightful to take to study again, and to feel
that old and stupid as one may be, there is still in one's
mind a little power of improvement.... The longer I
live the more do I feel my utter childlike helplessness
about all practical affairs. Certainly a creature with
such useless hands was never before seen. I seem to need
a dry nurse quite as much as my children. What useful
thing can I possibly teach these poor little monkeys?
For everything that is not soul I am an ass, that I am.
I have now been at Green Peace some six weeks, and it
is very pleasant and quiet, but oh! the season is so backward;
it is the 17th of May, and the trees are only beginning

month by a really fine opera, the troupe from Havana,
much better than the N. Y. troupe, with a fine orchestra
and chorus, all Italians. The Prima Donna is an
artist of the first order, and has an exquisite voice. I
have had season tickets, and have been nearly every
night. This is a great indulgence, as it is very expensive,
and I have one of the best boxes in the house, but
Chev is the most indulgent of husbands. I never knew
anything like it. Think of all he allows me, a house
and garden, a delicious carriage and pair of horses, etc.,
etc., etc. My children are coming on famously. Julia,
or as she calls herself, Romana, is really a fine creature,
full of sensibility and of talent. She learns very readily,
and reasons about things with great gravity. She
remembers every tune that she hears, and can sing a
great many songs. She is very full of fun, and so is my
sweet Flossy, my little flaxen-haired wax doll. I play
for them on the piano, Lizzie beats the tambourine,
and the two babies take hold of hands and dance. "Is
not your heart fully satisfied with such a sight?" you
will ask me. I reply, dear Wevie, that the soul whose
desires are not fixed upon the unattainable is dead
even while it liveth, and that I am glad, in the midst of
all my comforts, to feel myself still a pilgrim in pursuit
of something that is neither house nor lands, nor children,
nor health. What that something is I scarce
know. Sometimes it seems to me one thing and sometimes
another. Oh, immortality, thou art to us but a
painful rapture, an ecstatic burthen in this earthly life.

The arms of the cross will one day turn into angels'
wings, and lift us up to heaven. Don't think from this
rhapsody that I am undergoing a fit of pietistic exaltation.
I am not, but as I grow older, many things
become clearer to me, and I feel at once the difficulty
and the necessity of holding fast to one's soul and to
its divine relationships, lest the world should cheat us
of it utterly.</p></blockquote>

dresses of bright pink plaid, made very full and reaching
only to the knee, with pink ribbands in their
sleeves....</p>

<p>How I do wish for you this summer. My little place
is so green, my flowers so sweet, my strawberries so
delicious&mdash;the garden produces six quarts or more a
day. The cow gives delicious cream. I even make a
sort of cream cheese which is not by any means to be
despised. Do you eat <i>ricotta</i> nowadays? Chev gave me
a little French dessert set yesterday, which made my
table look so pretty. White with very rich blue and
gold. Oh, but it was bunkum! Dear old Wevie, you
must give me one summer, and then I will give you a
winter&mdash;isn't that fair? Chev promises to take me
abroad in five years, if we should sell Green Peace well.
They talk of moving the Institution, in which case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
I should have to leave my pretty Green Peace in two
years more, but I should be sad to leave it, for it is very
lovely. I don't know any news at all to communicate.
The President<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> has just made a visit here; he was
coolly but civilly received. His whole course has been
very unpopular in Massachusetts, and nobody wanted
to see the man who had brought this cursed Mexican
War upon us. He was received by the Mayor with a
brief but polite address, lodgings were provided for him,
and a dinner given him by the city. But there was no
crowd to welcome him, no shouts, no waving of handkerchiefs.
The people quietly looked at him and said,
"This is our chief magistrate, is it? Well, he is <i>très peu
de chose</i>." I of course did not trouble myself to go and
see him....I send you an extract from a daily paper.
Can you tell me who is the authoress? It has been
much admired. Uncle John was very much tickled to
see <i>somebody</i> in print. Try it again, Blue Jacket.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wayward moods shown in these letters sometimes
found other expression. In those days her wit
was wayward too: its arrows were always winged, and
sometimes over-sharp. In later life, when Boston and
everything connected with it was unspeakably dear to
her, she would not recall the day when, passing on
Charles Street the Charitable Eye and Ear Infirmary,
she read the name aloud and exclaimed, "Oh! I did
not know there was a charitable eye or ear in Boston!"
Or that other day, when having dined with the Ticknors,
a family of monumental dignity, she said to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
friend afterward, "Oh! I am so cold! I have been dining
with the <i>Tête Noir</i>, the <i>Mer(e) de Glace</i>, and the
<i>Jungfrau</i>!"</p>

<p>It may have been in these days that an incident occurred
which she thus describes in "A Plea for Humour":
"I once wrote to an intimate friend a very
high-flown and ridiculous letter of reproof for her frivolity.
I presently heard of her as ill in bed, in consequence
of my unkindness. I immediately wrote, 'Did
not you see that the whole thing was intended to be a
burlesque?' After a while she wrote back, 'I am just
beginning to see the fun of it, but the next time you
intend to make a joke, pray give me a fortnight's
notice.' It was now my turn to take to my bed."</p>

<p>In September, 1847, a heavy sorrow came to her in
the death of her brother Marion, "a gallant, gracious
boy, a true, upright and useful man." She writes to
her sister Louisa: "Let us thank Him that Marion's
life gave us as much joy as his death has given us pain....
Our children will grow up in love and beauty,
and one of us will have a sweet boy who shall bear
the dear name of Marion and make it doubly dear
to us."</p>

<p>This prophecy was fulfilled first by the birth, on
March 2, 1848, of Henry Marion Howe (named for
the two lost brothers), and again in 1854 by that of
Francis Marion Crawford.</p>

<p>The winter of 1847-48 was also spent in Boston, at
No. 74 Mount Vernon Street; here the first son was
born. The Doctor, recording his birth in the Family
Bible, wrote after the name, "<i>Dieu donné!</i>" And, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
mind full of the Revolution of 1848 in France, added,
"<i>Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité!</i>"</p>

<p>On April 18 she writes: "My boy will be seven weeks
old to-morrow, and ... such a darling little child was
never seen in this world before.... I shall have some
fears lest his temperament partake of the melancholy
which oppressed me during the period of his <i>creation</i>,
but so far he is so placid and gentle, that we call him the
little saint.... I have seen little of the world since his
birth, and thought still less. I shall try to pursue my
studies as I have through this last year, for I am good
for nothing without them. I will rather give up the
world and cut out Beacon Street, but an hour or two
for the cultivation of my poor little soul I must and
will have...."</p>

<p>... My literary reputation is growing apace. Mr.
Buchanan Read has written to me from Philadelphia
to beg some poetry for a book he is about to publish,
and I am going to hunt up some trash for him in the
course of the week. I find that my name has been advertised
in relation to Griswold's book<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>&mdash;people come

I should make a horribly shabby appearance. Do tell

<blockquote>
<div class="signature">
Sunday, December 15, 1849.<br />
</div>

<p>... I do want to see you, best Annie, and to have a
few long talks with you about theology, the soul, the
heart, life, matrimony, and the points of resemblance
between the patriarch Noah and Sir Tipsy Squinteye.
Those talks, madam, are not to be had, so instead of
the rich <i>crême fouettée</i> of our conversation, we will take
an insipid water-ice of a letter together, the two spoons
being ourselves, the sugar, ice and lemon representing
our three husbands, all mixed up together, the whole
to be considered good when one can't get anything
better. I will be hanged, however, if you shall make
me say which is which.</p>

<p>I pass my life after a singular manner, Annie. I am
in the old room, in the old house, even in the old dressing-gown,
which is of some value, inasmuch as it furnishes
my <i>rent</i>. I am in the old place, but the old Dudie
is not in me; in her stead is a spirit of crossness and
dullness, insensible to all the gentler influences of life,
knowing no music, poetry, wit, or devotion, intent
mainly upon holding on to the ropes, and upon getting
through the present without too much consciousness of
it.... All society has been paralyzed by the shocking
murder of Dr. Parkman. There has perhaps never been
in Boston so horrible and atrocious an affair. The
details of the crime are too heart-sickening to be dwelt
upon. There can scarcely be a doubt of the guilt of
Dr. Webster&mdash;the jury of inquest have returned a
verdict of guilty, but he has still a chance for his life,
as his trial in court does not come on for some months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
The wisest people say that he will be convicted and
hanged. I saw Dr. Parkman two or three days before
he was missing&mdash;he was an old friend of Chev's....
I have not been able to see much company, yet we
have had a few pleasant people at the house, now and
then. Among these, a Mr. Twisleton, brother of Lord
Saye and Sele, the most agreeable John Bull I have
seen this many a day, or indeed ever....</p></blockquote>


<p>The winter of 1849-50 was also spent at No. 74
Mount Vernon Street. Here, in February, 1850, a third
daughter was born, and named Laura for Laura Bridgman.
In the spring, our parents made a second voyage
to Europe, taking with them the two youngest children,
Julia Romana and Florence being left in the
household of Dr. Edward Jarvis.</p>

<p>They spent some weeks in England, renewing the
friendships made seven years before; thence they journeyed
to Paris, and from there to Boppart, where the
Doctor took the water cure. Julia seems to have been
too busy for letter-writing during this year; the Doctor
writes to Charles Sumner of the beauty of Boppart,
and adds: "Julia and I have been enjoying walks upon
the banks of the Rhine, and rambles upon the hillside,
and musings among the ruins, and jaunts upon the
waters as we have enjoyed nothing since we left
home."</p>

<p>He had but six months' leave of absence; it was felt
by both that Julia needed a longer time of rest and
refreshment; accordingly when he returned she, with
the two little children, joined her sisters, both now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
married, and the three proceeded to Rome, where they
spent the winter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crawford was living at Villa Negroni, where
Mrs. Mailliard became her companion; Julia found a
comfortable apartment in Via Capo le Case, with the
Edward Freemans on the floor above, and Mrs. David
Dudley Field on that below.</p>

<p>These were pleasant neighbors. Mrs. Freeman was
Julia's companion in many delightful walks and excursions;
when Mrs. Field had a party, she borrowed Mrs.
Howe's large lamp, and was ready to lend her tea-cups
in return. There was a Christmas tree&mdash;the first
ever seen in Rome!&mdash;at Villa Negroni; "an occasional
ball, a box at the opera, a drive on the Campagna."</p>

<p>Julia found a learned Rabbi from the Ghetto, and
resumed the study of Hebrew, which she had begun
the year before in South Boston. This accomplished
man was obliged to wear the distinctive dress then
imposed upon the Jews of Rome, and to be within the
walls of the Ghetto by six in the evening. There were
private theatricals, too, she appearing as "Tilburina"
in "The Critic."</p>

<p>Among the friends of this Roman winter none was
so beloved as Horace Binney Wallace. He was a Philadelphian,
a <i>rosso</i>. He held that "the highest effort of
nature is to produce a <i>rosso</i>"; he was always in search
of the favored tint either in pictures or in living beings.
Together the two <i>rossi</i> explored the ancient city, with
mutual pleasure and profit.</p>

<p>Some years later, on hearing of his death, she recalled
these days of companionship in a poem called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
"Via Felice,"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> which she sang to an air of her own
composition. The poem appeared in "Words for the
Hour," and is one of the tenderest of her personal
tributes:&mdash;</p>

<p>
For Death's eternal city<br />
Has yet some happy street;<br />
'Tis in the Via Felice<br />
My friend and I shall meet.<br />
</p>

<p>In the summer of 1851 she turned her face westward.
The call of husband, children, home, was imperative;
yet so deep was the spell which Rome had laid upon
her that the parting was fraught with "pain, amounting
almost to anguish." She was oppressed by the
thought that she might never again see all that had
grown so dear. Looking back upon this time, she says,
"I have indeed seen Rome and its wonders more than
once since that time, but never as I saw them then."</p>

<p>The homeward voyage was made in a sailing-vessel,
in company with Mr. and Mrs. Mailliard. They were
a month at sea. In the long quiet mornings Julia read
Swedenborg's "Divine Love and Wisdom"; in the
afternoons Eugène Sue's "<i>Mystères de Paris</i>," borrowed
from a steerage passenger. There was whist in
the evening; when her companions had gone to rest
she would sit alone, thinking over the six months,
weaving into song their pleasures and their pains. The
actual record of this second Roman winter is found in
"Passion Flowers."</p>

The rose that makes the summer fair,<br />
The velvet robe that sovereigns wear,<br />

<p><br />We have seen that from her earliest childhood
Julia Ward's need of expressing herself in verse was
imperative. Every emotion, deep or trivial, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
take metrical shape; she laughed, wept, prayed&mdash;even
stormed, in verse.</p>

<p>Walking with her one day, her sister Annie, always
half angel, half sprite, pointed to an object in the
road. "Dudie dear," she said; "squashed frog! little
verse, dear?"</p>

<p>We may laugh with the two sisters, but under the
laughter lies a deep sense of the poet's nature.</p>

<p>As in her dreamy girlhood she prayed&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh! give me back my golden lyre!"&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>so in later life she was to pray&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"On the Matron's time-worn mantle</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Let the Poet's wreath be laid."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The tide of song had been checked for a time; after
the second visit to Rome, it flowed more freely than
ever. By the winter of 1853-54, a volume was ready
(the poems chosen and arranged with the help of
James T. Fields), and was published by Ticknor and
Fields under the title of "Passion Flowers."</p>

<p>No name appeared on the title-page; she had
thought to keep her <i>incognito</i>, but she was recognized
at once as the author, and the book became the literary
sensation of the hour. It passed rapidly through
three editions; was, she says, "much praised, much
blamed, and much called in question."</p>

<p>She writes to her sister Annie:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The history of all these days, beloved, is comprised
in one phrase, the miseries of proof-reading. Oh, the
endless, endless plague of looking over these proof-sheets&mdash;the
doubts about phrases, rhymes, and expressions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the perplexity of names, especially, in which I
have not been fortunate. To-morrow I get my last
proof. Then a fortnight must be allowed for drying
and binding. Then I shall be out, fairly out, do you
hear? So far my secret has been pretty well kept.
My book is to bear a simple title without my name,
according to Longfellow's advice. Longfellow has
been reading a part of the volume in sheets. He says
it will make a sensation.... I feel much excited,
quite unsettled, sometimes a little frantic. If I succeed,
I feel that I shall be humbled by my happiness,
devoutly thankful to God. Now, I will not write any
more about it."</p></blockquote>

<p>The warmest praise came from the poets,&mdash;the
"high, impassioned few" of her "Salutatory." Whittier
wrote:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>A thousand thanks for thy volume! I rec'd it some
days ago, but was too ill to read it. I glanced at
"Rome," "Newport and Rome," and they excited me
like a war-trumpet. To-day, with the wild storm drifting
without, my sister and I have been busy with thy
book, and basking in the warm atmosphere of its
flowers of passion. It is a great book&mdash;it has placed
thee at the head of us all. I like its noble aims, its
scorn and hate of priestcraft and Slavery. It speaks
out bravely, beautifully all I have <i>felt</i>, but could not
express, when contemplating the condition of Europe.
God bless thee for it!</p>

<p>I owe an apology to Dr. Howe, if not to thyself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
for putting into verse<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> an incident of his early life
which a friend related to me. When I saw his name
connected with it, in some of the papers that copied
it, I felt fearful that I had wounded, perhaps, the
feelings of one I love and honor beyond almost any
other man, by the liberty I have taken. I can only say
I could not well help it&mdash;a sort of necessity was
before me, to say what I did.</p>

<p>I wish I <i>could</i> tell thee how glad thy volume has
made me. I have marked it all over with notes of
admiration. I dare say it has faults enough, but thee
need not fear on that account. It has beauty enough
to save thy "slender neck" from the axe of the critical
headsman. The veriest "de'il"&mdash;as Burns says&mdash;"wad
look into thy face and swear he could na
wrang thee."</p>

<p>I am just leaving home with much ado of happy
preparation for an absence of five weeks, but must
take a few moments to thank you for the happiness
your gift brings me. It was very kind in you to send
it to me, who have forfeited all apparent claims to
such favor, by breaking all the laws of good neighborhood
in these years. But you were entirely right in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sending it, because, I fancy, that among all your
friends, few had so earnest a desire to know your
thoughts, and, I may say, so much regret at never
seeing you, as I. And the book, as I read in it, meets
this curiosity of mine, by its poems of character and
confidence, private lyrics, whose air and words [are]
all your own. I have not gone so far in them as to
have any criticism to offer you, and like better the
pure pleasure I find in a new book of poetry so warm
with life. Perhaps, when I have finished the book, I
shall ask the privilege of saying something further.
At present I content myself with thanking you.</p>

<p>This tribute from the beloved Autocrat touched her

she had recently reviewed some of his own work rather

<p><br />She writes her sister Annie:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"My book came out, darling, on Friday last. You
have it, I hope, ere this time. The simple title, 'Passion
Flowers,' was invented by Scherb<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and approved
by Longfellow. Its success became certain at once.
Hundreds of copies have already been sold, and every
one likes it. Fields foretells a second edition&mdash;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
sure to pay for itself. It has done more for me, in
point of consideration here, than a fortune of a hundred
thousand dollars. Parker quoted some of my
verses in his Christmas sermon, and this I considered
as the greatest of honors. I sat there and heard them,
glowing all over. The authorship is, of course, no
secret now...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking of the volume long after, she says, "It
was a timid performance upon a slender reed."</p>

<p>Three years later a second volume of verse was
published by Ticknor and Fields under the title of
"Words for the Hour." Of this, George William Curtis
wrote, "It is a better book than its predecessor,
but will probably not meet with the same success."</p>

<p>She had written plays ever since she was nine years
old. In 1857, the same year which saw the publication
of "Words for the Hour," she produced her first
serious dramatic work, a five-act drama entitled
"The World's Own." It was performed in New York
at Wallack's Theatre, and in Boston with Matilda
Heron and the elder Sothern in the leading parts.
She notes that one critic pronounced the play "full
of literary merits and of dramatic defects"; and she
adds, "It did not, as they say, 'keep the stage.'"</p>

<p>Yet her brother Sam writes to her from New York:
"Lenore still draws the best houses; there was hardly
standing room on Friday night"; and again: "Mr.
Russell went last night, a second time, bought the
libretto, which I send you by this mail&mdash;declares
that there is not a grander play in our language. He
says that it is full of dramatic vigor, that the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
never flags&mdash;but that unhappily Miss H., with the
soul and self-abandonment of a great actress, lacks
those graces of elocution, which should set forth the
beauties of your verses."</p>

<p>Some of the critics blamed the author severely for
her choice of a subject&mdash;the betrayal and abandonment
of an innocent girl by a villain; they thought it
unfeminine, not to say indelicate, for a woman to
write of such matters.</p>

<p>At that time nothing could be farther from her
thoughts than to be classed with the advocates of
Women's Rights as they then appeared; yet in "The
World's Own" are passages which show that already
her heart cherished the high ideal of her sex, for which
her later voice was to be uplifted:&mdash;</p>

<p>
I think we call them Women, who uphold<br />
Faint hearts and strong, with angel countenance;<br />
Who stand for all that's high in Faith's resolve,<br />
Or great in Hope's first promise.<br /><br />

*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *
<br />
Ev'n the frail creature with a moment's bloom,<br />
That pays your pleasure with her sacrifice,<br />
And, having first a marketable price,<br />
Grows thenceforth valueless,&mdash;ev'n such an one,<br />
Lifted a little from the mire, and purged<br />
By hands severely kind, will give to view<br />
The germ of all we honor, in the form<br />
Of all that we abhor. You fling a jewel<br />
Where wild feet tramp, and crushing wheels go by;<br />
You cannot tread the splendor from its dust;<br />
So, in the shattered relics, shimmers yet<br />
Through tears and grime, the pride of womanhood.<br />
<br />
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *

<p>We must not forget the Comic Muse. Comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
little of her humorous verse is preserved; she seldom
thought it important enough to make two copies, and
the first draft was often lost or given away. The
following was written in the fifties, when Wulf Fries
was a young and much-admired musician in Boston.
Miss Mary Bigelow had invited her to her house "at
nine o'clock" to hear him play, meaning nine in the
morning. She took this for nine in the evening; the
rest explains itself:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Miss Mary Big'low, you who seem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So debonair and kind,</span><br />
Pray, what the devil do you mean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(If I may speak my mind)</span><br />
<br />
By asking me to come and hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That Wulf of yours a-Friesing,</span><br />
Then leaving me to cool my heels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In manner so unpleasing?</span><br />
<br />
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />
<br />
With Mrs. Dr. Susan you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That eve, forsooth, were tea-ing:</span><br />
Confess you knew that I should come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And from my wrath were fleeing!</span><br />
<br />
To Mrs. Dr. Susan's I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Had not invited been:</span><br />
So when the maid said, "Best go there!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I answered, "Not so green!"</span><br />
<br />
Within the darksome carriage hid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I bottled up my beauty,</span><br />
And, rather foolish, hurried home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To fireside and duty.</span><br />
<br />
It's very pleasant, <i>you</i> may think,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On winter nights to roam;</span><br />
But when you next invite abroad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>This</i> wolf will freeze at home!</span><br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>While she was pouring out her heart in poem and
play, and the Doctor was riding the errands of the
hour and binding up the wounds of Humanity, what,
it may be asked,&mdash;it <i>was</i> asked by anxious friends,&mdash;was
becoming of the little Howes? Why, the little
Howes (there were now five, Maud having been born
in November, 1854) were having perhaps the most
wonderful childhood that ever children had. Spite of
the occasional winters spent in town, our memories
centre round Green Peace;&mdash;there Paradise blossomed
for us. Climbing the cherry trees, picnicking
on the terrace behind the house, playing in the bowling-alley,
tumbling into the fishpond,&mdash;we see ourselves
here and there, always merry, always vigorous and
robust. We were also studying, sometimes at school,
sometimes with our mother, who gave us the earliest
lessons in French and music; more often, in those
years, under various masters and governesses. The
former were apt to be political exiles, the Doctor always
having many such on hand, some learned, all
impecunious, all seeking employment. We recall a
Pole, a Dane, two Germans, one Frenchman. The
last, poor man, was married to a Smyrniote woman
with a bad temper; neither spoke the other's language,
and when they quarrelled they came to the Doctor,
demanding his services as interpreter.</p>

<p>Through successive additions, the house had grown
to a goodly size; the new part, with large, high-studded
rooms, towering above the ancient farmhouse, which
nevertheless seemed always the heart of the place. Between
the two was a conservatory, a posy of all sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
flowers: the large greenhouse was down in the garden,
under the same roof as the bowling-alley.</p>

<p>The pears and peaches and strawberries of Green
Peace were like no others that ever ripened; we see
ourselves tagging at our father's heels, watching his
pruning and grafting with an absorption equalling
his own, learning from him that there must be honor
in gardens as elsewhere, and that fruit taken from
his hand was sweet, while stolen fruit would be
bitter.</p>

<p>We see ourselves gathered in the great dining-room,
where the grand piano was, and the Gobelin carpet
with the strange beasts and fishes, bought at the sale
of the ex-King Joseph Bonaparte's furniture at Bordentown,
and the Snyders' Boar Hunt, which one of
us could never pass without a shiver; see ourselves
dancing to our mother's playing,&mdash;wonderful dances,
invented by Flossy, who was always <i>première danseuse</i>,
and whose "Lady Macbeth" dagger dance was a thing
to remember.</p>

<p>Then perhaps the door would open, and in would
come "Papa" as a bear, in his fur overcoat, growling
horribly, and chase the dancers into corners, they
shrieking terrified delight.</p>

<p>Again, we see ourselves clustered round the piano
while our mother sang to us; songs of all nations, from
the Polish drinking-songs that Uncle Sam had learned
in his student days in Germany, down to the Negro
melodies which were very near our hearts.</p>

<p>Best of all, however, we loved her own songs: cradle-songs
and nursery nonsense made for our very selves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>
"(Sleep, my little child.<br />
So gentle, sweet and mild!<br />
The little lamb has gone to rest,<br />
The little bird is in its nest,&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>"Put in the donkey!" cries Laura. The golden voice
goes on without a pause&mdash;</p>

<p>
"The little donkey in the stable<br />
Sleeps as sound as he is able;<br />
All things now their rest pursue,<br />
You are sleepy too!)"<br />
</p>

<p>Again, she would sing passionate songs of love or battle,
or hymns of lofty faith and aspiration. One and
all, we listened eagerly; one and all, we too began to
see visions and dream dreams.</p>

<p>Now and then, the Muse and Humanity had to
stand aside and wait while the children had a party;
such a party as no other children ever had. What
wonder, when both parents turned the full current
of their power into this channel?</p>

<p>Our mother writes of one such festival:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My guests arrived in omnibus loads at four o'clock.
My notes to parents concluded with the following P.S.:
'Return-omnibus provided, with insurance against
plum-cake and other accidents.' A donkey carriage
afforded great amusement out of doors, together with
swing, bowling-alley, and the Great Junk. While all
this was going on, the H.'s, J. S., and I prepared a
theatrical exhibition, of which I had made a hasty
outline. It was the story of 'Blue Beard.' We had curtains
which drew back and forth, and regular footlights.
You can't think how good it was! There were
four scenes. My antique cabinet was the 'Blue Beard'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
cabinet; we yelled in delightful chorus when the door
was opened, and the children stretched their necks to
the last degree to see the horrible sight. The curtain
closed upon a fainting-fit done by four women. In the
third scene we were scrubbing the fatal key, when I
cried out, 'Try the "Mustang Liniment"! It's the
liniment for us, for you know we <i>must hang</i> if we don't
succeed!' This, which was made on the spur of the
moment, overcame the whole audience with laughter,
and I myself shook so that I had to go down into the
tub in which we were scrubbing the key. Well, to make
a long story short, our play was very successful, and
immediately afterward came supper. There were four
long tables for the children; twenty sat at each. Ice-cream,
cake, blanc-mange, and delicious sugar-plums,
oranges, etc., were served up 'in style.' We had our
supper a little later. Three omnibus loads went from
my door; the last&mdash;the grown people&mdash;at nine
o'clock."</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have written a play for our doll-theatre, and
performed it yesterday afternoon with great success.
It occupied nearly an hour. I had alternately to grunt
and squeak the parts, while Chev played the puppets.
The effect was really extremely good. The spectators
were in a dark room, and the little theatre, lighted by
a lamp from the top, looked very pretty."</p>

<p>It was one of these parties of which the Doctor wrote
to Charles Sumner: "Altogether it was a good affair,
a religious affair; I say religious, for there is nothing
which so calls forth my love and gratitude to God as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the sight of the happiness for which He has given the
capacity and furnished the means; and this happiness
is nowhere more striking than in the frolics of the
young."</p>

<p>Among the plays given at Green Peace were the
"Three Bears," the Doctor appearing as the Great
Big Huge Bear; and the "Rose and the Ring," in
which he played Kutasoff Hedzoff and our mother
Countess Gruffanuff, while John A. Andrew, not yet
Governor, made an unforgettable Prince Bulbo.</p>

<p>It was a matter of course to us children, that
"Papa and Mamma" should play with us, sing to us,
tell us stories, bathe our bumps, and accompany us to
the dentist; these were things that papas and mammas
did! Looking back now, with some realization of all the
other things they did, we wonder how they managed
it. For one thing, both were rapid workers; for another,
both had the power of leading and inspiring
others to work; for a third, so far as we can see, neither
ever wasted a moment; for a fourth, neither ever
reached the point where there was not some other
task ahead, to be begun as soon as might be.</p>

<p>Life with a Comet-Apostle was not always easy.
Some one once expressed to "Auntie Francis" wonder
at the patience with which she endured all the
troublesome traits of her much-loved husband. "My
dear," she replied, "I shipped as Captain's mate, for
the voyage!"</p>

<p>Our mother, quoting this, says, "I cannot imagine
a more useful motto for married life."</p>

<p>During the thirty-four years of her own married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
life the Doctor was captain, beyond dispute; yet sometimes
the mate felt that she must take her own way,
and took it quietly. She was fond of quoting the
words of Thomas Garrett,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> whose house was for years
a station of the Underground Railway, and who helped
many slaves to freedom.</p>

<p>"How did you manage it?" she asked him.</p>

<p>His reply sank deep into her mind.</p>

<p>"It was borne in upon me at an early period, that
if I told no one what I intended to do, I should be
enabled to do it."</p>

<p>The bond between our mother and father was not
to be entirely broken even by death. She survived him
by thirty-four years; but she never discussed with any
one of us a question of deep import, or national consideration,
without saying, "Your father would think
thus, say thus!" It has been told elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> how she
once, being in Newport and waked from sleep by some
noise, called to him; and how he, in Boston, heard her,
and asked, when next they met, "Why did you call
me?" To the end of her life, if startled or alarmed,
she never failed to cry aloud, "Chev!"</p>

<p>Children were not the only guests at Green Peace.
Some of us remember Kossuth's visit; our mother
often told of the day when John Brown knocked at
the door, and she opened it herself. To all of us,
Charles Sumner and his brothers, Albert and George,
Hillard, Agassiz, Andrew, Parker were familiar figures,
and fit naturally into the background of Green Peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>Of these Charles Sumner, always the Doctor's closest
and best-beloved friend, is most familiarly remembered.
We called him "the harmless giant"; and one
of us was in the habit of using his stately figure as a
rule of measurement. Knowing that he was just six
feet tall, she would say that a thing was so much
higher or lower than Mr. Sumner. His deep musical
voice, his rare but kindly smile, are not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>We do not remember Nathaniel Hawthorne's coming
to the house, but his shy disposition is illustrated
by the record of a visit made by our parents to his
house at Concord. While they were in the parlor,
talking with Mrs. Hawthorne, they saw a tall, slim
man come down the stairs, and Mrs. Hawthorne
called out, "Husband! Husband! Dr. Howe and Mrs.
Howe are here!" Hawthorne bolted across the hall
and out through the door without even looking into
the parlor.</p>

<p>Of Whittier our mother says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall always be glad that I saw the poet Whittier
in his youth and mine. I was staying in Boston during
the winter of 1847, a young mother with two dear
girl babies, when Sumner, I think, brought Whittier
to our rooms and introduced him to me. His appearance
then was most striking. His eyes glowed like black
diamonds&mdash;his hair was of the same hue, brushed
back from his forehead. Several were present on this
occasion who knew him familiarly, and one of these
persons bantered him a little on his bachelor state.
Mr. Whittier said in reply: 'The world's people have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
taken so many of our Quaker girls that there is none
left for me.' A year or two later, my husband invited
him to dine, but was detained so late that I had a
tête-à-tête of half an hour with Mr. Whittier. We sat
near the fire, rather shy and silent, both of us. Whenever
I spoke to Whittier, he hitched his chair nearer
to the fire. At last Dr. Howe came in. I said to him
afterwards, 'My dear, if you had been a little later,
Mr. Whittier would have gone up the chimney.'"</p>

<p>The most welcome visitor of all was Uncle Sam
Ward. He came into the house like light: we warmed
our hands at his fire and were glad. It was not because
he brought us peaches and gold bracelets, Virginia
hams (to be boiled after his own recipe, with a
bottle of champagne, a wisp of new-mown hay and&mdash;we
forget what else!), and fine editions of Horace:
it was because he brought himself.</p>

<p>"I disagree with Sam Ward," said Charles Sumner,
"on almost every known topic: but when I have talked
with him five minutes I forget everything save that
he is the most delightful companion in the world!"</p>

<p>A volume might be filled with Uncle Sam's <i>mots</i>
and jests; but print would do him cold justice, lacking
the kindling of his eyes and smile, the mellow music
of his laugh. Memory pictures rise up, showing him
and our mother together in every variety of scene. We
see them coming out of church together after a long
and dull sermon, and hear him whisper to her, "<i>Ce
pauvre Dieu!</i>"</p>

<p>Again, we see them driving together after some
function at which the address of one Potts had roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Uncle Sam to anger; hear him pouring out a torrent of
eloquent vituperation, forgetting all else in the joy of
freeing his mind. Pausing to draw breath, he glanced
round, and, seeing an unfamiliar landscape, exclaimed,
"Where are we?" "At Potsdam, I think!" said our
mother quietly.</p>

<p>Hardly less dear to us than Green Peace, and far
dearer to her, was the summer home at Lawton's
Valley, in Portsmouth,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Rhode Island. Here, as at
South Boston, the Doctor's genius for "construction
and repairs" wrought a lovely miracle. He found
a tiny farmhouse, sheltered from the seawinds by a
rugged hillock; near at hand, a rocky gorge, through
which tumbled a wild little stream, checked here and
there by a rude dam; in one place turning the wheel
of a mill, where the neighboring farmers brought corn
to grind. His quick eye caught the possibilities of the
situation. He bought the place and proceeded to make
of it a second earthly paradise. The house was enlarged,
trees were felled here, planted there; a garden
appeared as if by magic; in the Valley itself the turbulent
stream was curbed by stone embankments;
the open space became an emerald lawn, set at intervals
with Norway spruces; under the great ash tree
that towered in the centre rustic seats and tables were
placed. Here, through many years, the "Mistress of
the Valley" was to pass her happiest hours; to the
Valley and its healing balm of quiet she owed the
inspiration of much of her best work.</p>

<p>The following letters fill in the picture of a time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
which in her later years she looked back as one of the
happiest of her life.</p>

<p>Yet she was often unhappy, sometimes suffering.
Humanity, her husband's faithful taskmistress, had
not yet set her to work, and the long hours of his
service left her lonely, and&mdash;the babies once in bed&mdash;at
a loss.</p>

<p>Her eyes, injured in Rome, in 1843, by the throwing
of <i>confetti</i> (made, in those days, of lime), gave her
much trouble, often exquisite pain. She rarely, in
our memory, used them in the evening. Yet, in later
life, all the miseries, little and big, were dismissed
with a smile and a sigh and a shake of the head. "I
was very naughty in those days!" she would say.</p>

<p>I have kept a long silence with you, but I suppose
that it is too evident before this time that letter-writing
is not my <i>forte</i>, to need any further explanation
of such a fact. Let me say, however, once for all,
that I do not stand upon my reputation as a letter-writer.
About my poetry and my music, I may be
touchy and exacting&mdash;about my talents for drawing,
correspondence, and housekeeping, I can only say
that my pretensions are as small as my merits. With
such humility, Justice herself must be satisfied. It is
Modesty with her pink lining (commonly mistaken
for blushes) turned outside. Are you surprised, my
love, at the new style of my writing, and do you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
I must have been taking lessons of Mr. Bristow? Learn
that my eyes do not allow me to look attentively at
my writing, and that I give a glance and a scribble,
in a truly frantic and indiscriminate manner. Having
ruined my own eyes, you see, I am doing my utmost
to ruin the eyes of my friends. This is human nature&mdash;all
evil seeks thus to propagate itself, while good is
satisfied with itself, and stays where it is. When I
think of this, I ask myself, does not the devil, then,
send missionaries? You will agree with me that he
at least sends ambassadors. I have passed, so far, a
very studious winter. Never, since my youth, have
I lived so much in reading and writing&mdash;hence these
eyes! Of course, you exclaim, what madness! but,
indeed, I should have a worse madness if I did not
cram myself with books. The bareness and emptiness
of life were then insupportable....</p>

<p>Of the nearly eighteen months since my return to
America, I have passed fourteen at South Boston.
Last winter I was fresh from my travels, and had still
strength enough to keep up my relation with society,
and to invite people a good deal to my house. But
this year I am more worn down, my health quite impaired,
and the exertion of going out or receiving at
home is too much for me....</p>

<p>I have made acquaintance with the Russell Lowells,
but we are too far apart to profit much by it. I cannot
swim about in this frozen ocean of Boston life in search
of friends. I feel as if I had struggled enough with it,
as if I could now fold my arms and go down....</p></blockquote>

</p>

<p>I have been of late a shamefully bad correspondent,
and am as much ashamed of it as I ought to be. But,
indeed, it hurts my eyes so dreadfully to write, and
<i>that</i> you may find it difficult to believe, for perhaps
you find writing less trying to the eyes than reading.
Most people do, but with me the contrary is the case.
I can read with tolerable comfort, but cannot write
a single page, without positive pain. Well, that is
enough about my eyes; now for other things. You
say that you tremble to know the result of the Lace
purchase. Well you may, wretched woman. Don't
be satisfied with trembling; shake! shiver! shrink into
nothing at all! Do you know, Madam, that my cursed
bill from Hooker amounted to over $130? The rascal
charged me ten per cent, which you and he probably
divided together, or had a miscellaneous spree upon.
You sent no specification of items. Madam, to this
day, I do not know whether the earrings or the lace
cost the most. People ask me the price of bertha,
flounces and earrings, I can only reply that Mrs. Crawford
drew upon me for an enormous sum of money,
but that I have no idea how she spent it. Moreover,
my poor little means (a favorite expression of Annie
Mailliard's) have been entirely exhausted by you and
Hooker. My purse is in a dangerous state of collapse&mdash;my
credit all gone long ago. I want a coat, a bonnet,
stockings, and pkthdkfs, but when for want of these
things I am cold and snuffly, I go and take out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
flounces, look at them, turn them over, and say: "Well,
they are <i>very</i> warming for the price, aren't they?"
Besides, you send me a bill, and don't send Aunt Lou
McAllister any. Who paid for her Malachites? I
have a great mind to say that I did, and pocket the
money, which she is anxious to pay, if she could only
get her account settled, which please to attend to at
once, you lymphatic, agreeable monster! About the
mosaics, straw for Bonnets, and worsted work, you
were right in supposing that I would not be very angry.
It was undoubtedly a liberty, your sending them,
but it is one which I can make up my mind to overlook,
especially as you will not be likely to do it again
for some time.</p>

<p>Now, if you really want to know about the lace, I
will tell you that I found it perfectly magnificent, and
that every one who sees it admires it prodigiously. If
this is the case now, before I have worn it, how much
more will it be so when it shall show itself abroad
heightened by the charms of my person! Admiration
will then know no bounds. Newspaper paragraphs will
begin thus: "The lovely wearer of the lace is about
thirty-four years of age, but looks much older&mdash;in
fact, nearly as antique as her own flounces," etc., etc.
The ornaments are not less beautiful, in their kind.
I wear them on distinguished occasions, and at sight
of them, people who have closely adhered to the Decalogue
all their lives incontinently violate the Tenth
Commandment, and then excuse it by saying that Mrs.
Howe does not happen to be their neighbor, living as
she does beyond the reach of everything but Omnibuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and Charity. So you see that I consider the investment
a most successful one, and may in future honor
you with more commissions. I even justify it to myself
on the ground that the Brooch and earrings will
make charming pins for my three girls, while the lace,
Mrs. Cary says, is as good as Real Estate. So set your
kind heart completely at rest, you <i>could</i> not have done
better for me, or if you could, I don't know it. As to
my being without pocket handkerchiefs, you will be the
first to reply that <i>that</i> is nothing new. Now for your
charming presents; I was greatly delighted at them.
The Mosaics are perfectly exquisite, the most beautiful
I ever saw. The straw is very handsome, and will
make me the envy of Newport, next summer. The
worsted work appears to me rich and quaint, and shall
be made up as soon as circumstances shall allow. For
each and all accept my hearty thanks....</p></blockquote>

<p>... I went in town [Newport] the other day, and dined
with Fanny Longfellow. The L.'s, Curtis,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Tommo,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and
Kensett are all living together, but seem to make out
tolerably. After dinner Fanny took me to drive on the
Beach in her Barouche. I looked fine, wore my grey
grapery with my drapery, and spread myself out as
much as possible. Curtis took Julia in his one-horse
affair on the Beach. Julia wore a pink silk dress, a
white drawn bonnet with pink ribbons, and a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
white shawl. Oh, she did look lovely. Mamma was
not at all proud, oh, no! Well, thereafter, I dined elsewhere
and did not want to tell Dudie where. So when
she asked, "Where did you dine yesterday?" I replied:
"I dined, dear, with Mrs. Jimfarlan, and her pig was
at table. Now, before we sat down, Mrs. J. said to me,
'Mrs. Howe, if you do not love my pig, you cannot
dine with me,' and I replied, 'Mrs. Jimfarlan, I adore
your pig,' so down we sat." "Oh, yes, Mamma," says
Julia, "and I know the rest. When you had got
through dinner, and had had all you wanted, you rose,
and told the lady that you had something to tell her
in the greatest confidence. Then she went into the
entry with you, and you whispered in her ear, 'Mrs.
Jimfarlan, I <i>hate</i> your pig!' and then rushed out of the
house."... I have had one grand tea-party&mdash;the
Longos, Curtis, etc., etc. We had tea out of doors
and read Tennyson in the valley. It was very pleasant....
The children spent Tuesday with the Hazards.
I went over to tea. You remember the old beautiful
place.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> We have now a donkey tandem, which is the

<p>I will tell you how I have been living since my return
from Newport. I get up at seven or a little before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and am always down at half-past for breakfast. After
breakfast I despatch the chicks to school and clear off
the table; then walk in the garden or around the house;
then consult with the cook and order dinner, and see as
far as I can to all sewing and other work. I get to my
own room between ten and eleven, where I study and
write until two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Dinner is at half-past two. After
that I take all the children in my room. I read to them
and fix worsted work for them. I get half an hour's
reading for myself sometimes, but not often, the days
being so short. Then I walk with dear Julia, the dearest
little friend in the world. The others often join
us, and sometimes we have the donkey for a ride. I
then go in and sing for the children, or play for them
to dance, until tea-time. At a quarter past eight I
go to put Dudie and Flossy to bed. I prolong this last
pleasure and occupation of the day. When I come down
I sit with idle fingers, unable, as you know, to do
the least thing. Chev reads the papers to me. At ten
I am thankful to retire. I do not suppose that this
life is more monotonous than yours in Bordentown,
is it?...</p>

<p><i>Oct. 19th.</i> I was not able to finish this at one sitting,
my best darling. I cannot write long without great
pain. I had to go in town on Monday and Tuesday,
and yesterday, for a wonder, Baby [Laura] was ill. She
had severe rheumatic pains in both knees, and could
not be moved all day. We sent for a physician, who
prescribed various doses, and told us we should have a
siege of it. To-day she is almost well, though we gave
her no medicine. She is the funniest little soul in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
world. You should hear her admonishing her father
not to "worry so about everything." He is obliged to
laugh in spite of himself.... I am very poor just now.
I furnished my Newport house with the money for
my book ["Passion Flowers"]. It was very little&mdash;about
$200.</p></blockquote>


<p>Spite of the troublesome eyes, and the various
"pribbles and prabbles," she was in those days editor-in-chief
of "The Listener," a "Weekly Publication."
Julia Romana was sub-editor, and furnished most of
the material, stories, plays, and poems pouring with
astonishing ease from her ten-year-old pen; but there
was an Editor's Table, sometimes dictated by the
chief editor, often written in her own hand.</p>

<p>The first number of "The Listener" appeared in
October, 1854. The sub-editor avows frankly that "The
first number of our little paper will not be very interesting,
as we have not had time to give notice to those
who we expect to write for it."</p>

<p>This is followed by "Select Poetry, Mrs. Howe";
"The Lost Suitor" (to be continued), and "Seaside
Thoughts." The "Editor's Table" reads:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is often said that Listeners hear no good of themselves,
and it often proves to be true. But we shall
hope to hear, at least, no harm of our modest little
paper. We intend to listen only to good things, and
not to have ears for any unkind words about ourselves
or others. Little people of our age are expected to
listen to those who are older, having so many things
to learn. We will promise, too, to listen as much as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
can to all the entertaining news about town, and to
give accounts of the newest fashions, the parties in
high life (nurseries are generally three stories <i>high</i>)
and many other particulars. So, we venture to hope
that 'The Listener' will find favour with our friends
and Miss Stephenson's select public."</p>

<p>This was Miss Hannah Stephenson's school for
girls, which Julia and Florence were attending. "The
Listener" gives pleasant glimpses of life at Green
Peace, the Nursery Fair, the dancing-school, the new
baby, and so forth.</p>

<p>Sometimes the "Table" is a rhyming one:&mdash;</p>

<p>
What shall we do for an Editor's table?<br />
To make one really we are not able.<br />
Our Editorial head is aching,<br />
Our lily white hand is rather shaking.<br />

<p>On January 14, 1855, we read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last evening began the opera season. Now, as all
the Somebodies were there, we would not like to have
you suppose, dear reader, that we were not, although
perhaps you did not see us, with our little squeezed-up
hat slipping off of our head, and we screwing up our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
eyebrows to keep it on. There was a moment when we
thought we felt it going down the back of our neck,
but a dexterous twitch of the left ear restored the
natural order of things. Well, to show you that we
were there, we'll tell you of what the Opera was composed.
There was love of course, and misery, and
plenty of both. The slim man married the lady in white,
and then ran away with another woman. She tore her
hair, and went mad. One of the stout gentlemen
doubled his fists, the other spread out his hands and
looked pitiful. The mad lady sang occasionally, and
retained wonderful command of her voice. They all felt
dreadfully, and went thro' a great deal, singing all the
time. The thing came right at last, but we have no
room to explain how."</p>

<p>... First of all you wish to know about the Bonnet,
of course. I am happy to say that it is entirely successful,
cheap, handsome, and becoming. Boston can show
nothing like it. As to the green and lilac, I all but sleep
in it. I never wear it, glory on my soul, without attracting
notice. Those who don't know me, at lectures
and sich, seem to say: "Good heavens, who is that
lovely creature?" Those who do know me seem to be
whispering to each other, "I never saw Julia Howe
look so well!" So much for the green bonnet. As for
the white one, since I took out the pinch behind, it fits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and flatters&mdash;to the Opera, I will incontinently wear
it. I have been there and still would go. Every woman
seen in front, seems to have a cap with a great frill,
like that of an old-fashioned night-cap; it is only when
she turns sideways that you can see the little hat
behind....</p>

<p>Did I write you that I have been to the Assembly?
Chev went to the first without me, with his niece, the
pretty one, of course, much to my vexation, so I
spunked up, and determined to go to the second. A
white silk dress was a necessary tho' unprofitable investment.
Turnbull had, fortunately for me, made a
failure, and was selling very cheap. I got a pretty silk
for $17, and had it made by a Boston fashionable
dressmaker, with three pinked flounces&mdash;it looked
unkimmon. Next I caused my hair to be dressed by
Pauline, the wife of Canegally. "Will you have it in
the newest fashion?" asked she; "the very newest,"
answered I. She put in front two horrid hair cushions
and, combing the hair over them, made a sort of turban
of hair, in which I was, may I say? captivating. I was
proud of my hair, and frequented rooms with looking-glasses
in them, the rest of the afternoon. At the
Ass-embly, Chev and I entered somewhat timidly,
but soon took courage, and parted company. Little
B&mdash;&mdash; (your neighbor of Bond St.) was there, wiggy
and smiley, but oh! so youthful!! Life is short, they
say, but I don't think so when I see little B&mdash;&mdash; trying
to look down upon me from beneath, and doing the
patronizing. There was something very nice about her,
however, that is, her pearl necklace with a diamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
clasp two inches long, and one and a half broad....
Oculist said weakness was the disease, and rest the
remedy&mdash;oculist recommended veratrine ointment,
frequent refreshing of eyes with wet cloth, cleared his
throat every minute, and was an old humbug.</p>

<p>They are playing at the Boston Museum a piece,
probably a farce, called "A Blighted Being." When
I see the handbills posted up in the streets it is like
reading one's own name. I must now bid you farewell

go back to live in two miserable rooms, with three
of her four children, cooking, and washing everything

I was there every day, and nearly all day, and at the
end of it I dropped like a dead person. Never did I
experience such fatigue&mdash;the crowd of faces, the bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
air, the responsibility of selling and the difficulty of
suiting everybody, was almost too much for me. On
the other hand, it was an entirely new experience,
and a very amusing one. My table was one of the
prettiest, and, as I took care to have some young and
pretty assistants, it proved one of the most attractive.
I cleared $426.00, which was doing pretty well, as I
had very little given me.... For a week after the Fair
I could do nothing but lie on a sofa or in an easy-chair, ...
but by the end of the week I revived, and it
pleased the Devil to suggest to me that this was the
moment to give a long promised party to the Governor
and his wife. All hands set to work, therefore, writing
notes. With the assistance of three Amanuenses I
scoured the whole surface of Boston society.... Unluckily
I had fixed upon an evening when there were
to be two other parties, and of course the cream of
the cream was already engaged. I believe in my soul
that I invited 300 people&mdash;every day everybody sent
word they could not come. I was full of anxiety, got
the house well arranged though, engaged a colored
man, and got a splendid supper. Miss Hunt, who is
writing for me, smacks her lips at the remembrance
of the same, I mean the supper, not the black man.
Well! the evening came, and with it all the odds and
ends of half a dozen sets of people, including some of
the most primitive and some of the most fashionable.
I had the greatest pleasure in introducing a dowdy
high neck, got up for the occasion, with short sleeves
and a bow behind, to the most elaborate of French ball-dresses
with head-dress to match, and leaving them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
take care of each other the best way they could. As
for the Governor [Nathaniel P. Banks], I introduced
him right and left to people who had never voted
for him and never will. The pious were permitted
to enjoy Theodore Parker, and Julia's schoolmaster
sat on a sofa and talked about Carlyle. I did not care&mdash;the
colored man made it all right. Imagine my
astonishment at hearing the party then and after
pronounced one of the most brilliant and successful
ever given in Boston. The people all said, "It is such
a relief to see new faces&mdash;we always meet the same
people at city parties." Well, darlings, the pickings of
the supper was very good for near a week afterwards,
and, having got through with my party, I have nearly
killed myself with going to hear Mr. Booth, whose
playing is beautiful exceedingly. Having for once in
my life had play enough and a great deal too much,
I am going to work to-morrow like an old Trojan
building a new city. I am too poor to come to New
York this spring; still it is not impossible. Farewell,

his large theories, which, like the circles made by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
stone thrown into the water, begin somewhere and
end nowhere. As we have said, he expounds himself
no more, the significant forefinger is down, the eye
no longer imprisons yours. But if you ask him how he
does, he shakes himself as if, like Farinata,&mdash;</p>

<p>
'<i>avesse l'inferno in gran dispetto</i>,'&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>he had a very contemptible opinion of hell."</p>

<p>Several "portraits" follow, among them her own.</p>

<p>"A woman, said to be of a literary turn of mind, in
the miserablest condition imaginable. Her clothes,
flung at her by the Stewardess, seem to have hit in
some places and missed in others. Her listless hands
occasionally make an attempt to keep her draperies
together, and to pull her hat on her head; but though
the intention is evident, she accomplishes little by her
motion. She is being perpetually lugged about by a
stout steward, who knocks her head against both
sides of the vessel, folds her up in the gangway, spreads
her out on the deck, and takes her upstairs, downstairs,
and in my lady's chamber, where, report says, he
feeds her with a spoon, and comforts her with such
philosophy as he is master of. N.B. This woman, upon
the first change of weather, rose like a cork, dressed
like a Christian, and toddled about the deck in the
easiest manner, sipping her grog, and cutting sly
jokes upon her late companions in misery;&mdash;is supposed
by some to have been an impostor, and, when
ill-treated, announced intentions of writing a book.</p>

<p>"No. 4, my last, is only a sketch;&mdash;circumstances
allowed no more. Can Grande,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> the great dog, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
been got up out of the pit, where he has worried the
Stewardess and snapped at the friend who tried to
pat him on the head. Everybody asks where he is.
Don't you see that heap of shawls yonder, lying in
the sun, and heated up to about 212° Fahrenheit? That
slouched hat on top marks the spot where his head
should lie,&mdash;by treading cautiously in the opposite
direction you may discover his feet. All between is
perfectly passive and harmless. His chief food is
pickles,&mdash;his only desire is rest. After all these years
of controversy, after all these battles, bravely fought
and nobly won, you might write with truth upon this
moveless mound of woollens the pathetic words from
Père La Chaise: <i>Implora Pace</i>."</p>

<p>The trip to Cuba was only the beginning of a long
voyage for the Parkers, who were bound for Italy.
The parting between the friends was sad. All felt that
they were to meet no more. Parker died in Florence
fifteen months later.</p>

<p>"A pleasant row brought us to the side of the
steamer. It was dusk already as we ascended her
steep gangway, and from that to darkness there is,
at this season, but the interval of a breath. Dusk too
were our thoughts, at parting from Can Grande, the
mighty, the vehement, the great fighter. How were
we to miss his deep music, here and at home! With
his assistance we had made a very respectable band;
now we were to be only a wandering drum and fife,&mdash;the
fife particularly shrill, and the drum particularly
solemn.... And now came silence, and tears,
and last embraces; we slipped down the gangway into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
our little craft, and looking up, saw bending above us,
between the slouched hat and the silver beard, the
eyes that we can never forget, that seemed to drop
back in the darkness with the solemnity of a last farewell.
We went home, and the drum hung himself
gloomily on his peg, and the little fife <i>shut up</i> for the
remainder of the evening."</p>

<p>"A Trip to Cuba" appeared first serially in the
"Atlantic Monthly," then in book form. Years after,
a friend, visiting Cuba, took with her a copy of the
little volume; it was seized at Havana by the customs
house officers, and confiscated as dangerous and incendiary
material.</p>

<p>On her return, our mother was asked to write regularly
for the New York "Tribune," describing the season
at Newport. This was the beginning of a correspondence
which lasted well into the time of the Civil
War. She says of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My letters dealt somewhat with social doings in
Newport and in Boston, but more with the great
events of the time. To me the experience was valuable
in that I found myself brought nearer in sympathy
to the general public, and helped to a better
understanding of its needs and demands."</p>

whom God bless, and will bless! I am much too dull
to write anything good about him, but shall say
something at the end of my book on Cuba, whereof
I am at present correcting the proof-sheets. I went
to see his poor wife, who passed through here some
days since. We shed tears together and embraced at
parting, poor soul! Folks say that the last number of
my Cuba is the best thing I ever did, in prose or verse.
Even Emerson wrote me about it from Concord. I
tell you this in case you should not find out of your
own accord that it is good. I have had rather an
unsettled autumn&mdash;have been very infirm and inactive,
but have kept up as well as possible&mdash;going
to church, also to Opera, also to hear dear Edwin
Booth, who is playing better than ever. My children
are all well and delightful....</p>

<p>I have finished Tacitus' history, also his Germans....
Chev is not at all annoyed by the newspapers,
but has been greatly overdone by anxiety and labor
for Brown. Much has come upon his shoulders, getting
money, paying counsel, and so on. Of course all
the stories about the Northern Abolitionists are the
merest stuff. No one knew of Brown's intentions but
Brown himself and his handful of men. The attempt
I must judge insane but the spirit <i>heroic</i>. I should be
glad to be as sure of heaven as that old man may
be, following right in the spirit and footsteps of the
old martyrs, girding on his sword for the weak and
oppressed. His death will be holy and glorious&mdash;the
gallows cannot dishonor him&mdash;he will hallow it....</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>On Christmas Day, 1859, she gave birth to a second
son, who was named Samuel Gridley. This latest and
perhaps dearest child was for three short years to fill
his parents' life with a joy which came and went with
him. His little life was all beautiful, all bright. We
associate him specially with the years we spent at
No. 13 Chestnut Street, Boston, a spacious and cheerful
house which we remember with real affection. The
other children were at school; little Sam was the
dear companion of our mother's walks, the delight of
our father's few leisure hours. For him new songs
were made, new games invented: both parents looked
forward to fresh youth and vigor in his sweet companionship.
This was not to be. "In short measures,
life may perfect be": little Sam died of diphtheritic
croup, May 17, 1863.</p>

<p>This heavy sorrow for a time crushed both these
tender parents to the earth. Our father became seriously
ill from grief; our mother, younger and more
resilient, found some relief in nursing him and caring
for the other children; but this was not enough. She
could not banish from her mind the terrible memory
of her little boy's suffering, the anguish of parting with
him. While her soul lifted its eyes to the hills, her
heart sought some way to keep his image constantly
before her. Her sad thoughts must be recorded, and
she took up, for the first time since 1843, the habit of
keeping a journal.</p>

<p>The first journal is a slender Diary and Memorandum
Book. On May 13, the first note of alarm is
sounded. Sammy "did not seem quite right." From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
that date the record goes on, the agonizing details
briefly described, the loss spoken of in words which
no one could read unmoved. But even this was not
enough: grief must find further expression, yet must
be repressed, so far as might be, in the presence of
others, lest her sorrow make theirs heavier. This need
of expression took a singular form. She wrote a letter
to the child himself, telling the story of his life and
death; wrote it with care and precision, omitting no
smallest detail, gathering, as it were a handful of
pearls, every slightest memory of the brief time.</p>

<p>A few extracts show the tenor of this letter:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p>
"<span class="smcap">My dearest little Sammy</span>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>"It is four weeks to-day since I saw your sweet face
for the last time on earth. It did not look like your
little face, my dear pet, it was so still, and sad, and
quiet. But Death had changed it, and I had to submit,
and was thankful to have even so much of you
as that still face, for some days. Everybody grieved
to part from you, dear little soul, but I suppose that
I grieved most of all, because you belonged most to
me. You were always with me, from the time you
began to exist at all. The time of your birth was a
sad one. It was the time of the imprisonment and
death of John Brown, a very noble man, who should
be in one of the many mansions of which Christ tells
us, and in which I hope, dear, that you are nearer to
Him than any of us can be....</p>

<p>"You arrived, I think, at three in the morning, very
red in the face, and making a great time about it. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
were a fine large Baby, weighing twelve pounds....
I have some of your baby dresses left, and shall
hunt them up and lay them with the clothes you have
worn lately.... I gave you milk myself.... I used
to lay you across my breast when you cried, and you
liked this so well that you often insisted upon sleeping
in that position after you were grown quite large. It
hurt me so much that I finally managed to break you
of the habit, but not until you were more than a year
old.... I had a nice crimson merino cloak made for
you, trimmed with velvet, and lined with white silk.
I bought also a very nice crochet cap, of white and
crimson worsted, and in these you were taken to drive
with me....</p>

<p>"During this first year of your life I had some
troubles, and your Baby ways were my greatest comfort.
I used to think: this Baby will grow up to be a
man, and will protect me when I am old. For I thought,
dear, that you should have outlived me many years.
But you are removed from us to grow in another
world, of which I know nothing but what Christ has
told me....</p>

<p>"You used to keep me awake a good deal at night,
and this sometimes made me nervous and fretful,
though I was usually very happy with you. I would
give a good deal for one of those bad nights now, though
at the time they were pretty hard upon me....</p>

<p>"... Your second summer brings me to the winter
that followed. It was quite a gay winter for us at old
South Boston. Marie, the German cook, made very
nice dishes, and I had many people to dine, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
or two pleasant evening parties. You still slept in my
room, and when I was going to a party in the evening,
Annie<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> used to bring my nice dress and my ornaments
softly out of the room, that I might dress in the nursery,
and not disturb your slumbers. I was always glad
to get home and undress, and it was always sweet to
come to the bed, and find you in it, sound asleep, and
lying right across.... I learned to sleep on a very little
bit of the bed, you wanted so much of it. This winter,
I bought you a pair of snow-boots, of which you were
very proud....</p>

<p>"We all got along happily, dear, till early in April
(1863), when your father desired me to make a journey
with Julia, who needed change of scene a little.
So I had to go and leave you, my sweet of sweets....</p>

<p>"We were glad enough to see each other again, you
and I, and I felt as if I could never part with you
again. But I was only to have you for a few days, my
darling....</p>

<p>"Thursday I sat up in your nursery, in the afternoon,
as I usually did, with my book&mdash;you having
your toys. When I had finished reading, I built houses
with blocks for you, and rolled the balls and dumbbells
across the floor to you. You rolled them back to
me and this amused you very much. I go to sit up
in your nursery in the afternoon now, with my book&mdash;the
light shines in now as it used to do, and I hear the
hand-organ and children's voices in the street. It
seems to bring you a little nearer to me, my dear lost
one, but not near enough for comfort."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>The child's illness and death are described minutely,
every symptom, every remedy, every anguish noted.
Then follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It gives me dreadful pain to recall these things and
write them down, my dearest. I don't do it to make
myself miserable, but in order that I may have some
lasting record of how you lived and died. You left
little by which you might be remembered, save the
love of kindred and friendly hearts, but in my heart,
dear, your precious image is deeply sculptured. All
my life will be full of grief for you, dearest Boy, and I
think that I shall hardly live as long as I should have
lived, if I had had you to make me happy. Perhaps
it seems very foolish that I should write all this, and
talk to you in it as if you could know what I write.
But, my little darling, it comforts me to think that
your sweet soul lives, and that you do know something
about me. Christ said, 'This day thou shalt be with
me in Paradise': and he knew that this was no vain
promise. So, believing the dear Christ, I am led along
to have faith in immortal life, of which, dear, I know
nothing of myself.</p>

<p>"Your little funeral, dear, was bitter and agonizing.
The good God does not send affliction without comfort,
but the weeping eyes and breaking heart must
struggle through much anguish before they can reach
it...."</p></blockquote>


<p>There was no hearse at this little funeral. The small
white casket was placed on the front seat in the carriage
in which she rode.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>"We came near the gate of Mount Auburn, when
I began to realize that the parting was very near. I
now opened the casket, took your dear little cold hand
in mine, and began to take silent farewell of you. And
here, dearest child, I must stop. The remembrance
of those last moments so cuts me to the heart, that I
cannot say one word more about them, and not much
about the life of loneliness and desolation which now
began for me, and of which I do not see the end. God
knows why I lost you, and how I suffer for you, and He
knows how and when I shall see you again, as I hope
to do, my dearest, because Christ says we are to live
again after this life, and I know that if I am immortal,
God will not inflict upon me the pain of an eternal
separation from you. So, we shall meet again, sweet
Angel Sammy. God grant that the rest of my life may
be worthy of this hope, more dear than life itself....</p>

<p>"I must finish these words by saying that I am
happy in believing that my dear Child lives, in a
broader land, with better teaching and higher joys
than I could have given him. I hope that the years
to come will brighten, not efface, my mind's picture
of him, and that among these, the cipher of one blessed
year is already written, in which the picture will become
reality, and the present sorrow the foundation of an
eternal joy."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following stanzas are chosen from among many
poems on little Sammy's life and death:&mdash;</p>


<p>REMEMBRANCE</p>
<p>
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />
So thou art hid again, and wilt not come<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>For any knockings at the veilèd door;<br />
Nor mother-pangs, nor nature, can restore<br />
The heart's delight and blossom of thy home.<br />
<br />
And I with others, in the outer court,<br />
Must sadly follow the excluding will,<br />
In painful admiration, of the skill<br />
Of God, who speaks his sweetest sentence short.<br />
</p>

<p>At this time she writes to her sister Annie:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I cannot yet write of what has come to me. Chev
and I feel that we are baptized into a new order of
suffering&mdash;those who have lost children, loving them,
can never be like those who have not. It makes a new
heaven and a new earth. The new heaven I have not
yet&mdash;the blow is too rough and recent. But the new
earth, sown with tears, with the beauty and glory gone
out of it, the spring itself, that should have made us
happy together, grown tasteless and almost hateful.
All the relish of life seems gone with him. I have no
patience to make phrases about it&mdash;for the moment
it seems utterness of doubt and of loss.</p>

<p>"No doubt about him. 'This night shalt thou be
with me in Paradise' was said by one who knew what
he promised. My precious Baby is with the Beautiful
One who was so tender with the children. But I am
alone, still fighting over the dark battle of his death,
still questioning whether there is any forgiveness for
such a death. Something must have been wrong
somewhere&mdash;to find it out, I have tortured myself
almost out of sanity. Now I must only say, it is, and
look and wait for divine lessons which follow our
bitter afflictions.</p>

<p>"God bless you all, darling. Ask dear Cogswell to
write me a few lines&mdash;tell him that this deep cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
makes all my previous life seem shallow and superficial.
Tell him to think of me a little in my great
sorrow.</p>

<p>She had by now definitely joined the Unitarian
Church, in whose doctrines her mind found full and
lasting rest; throughout this sorrowful time the Reverend
James Freeman Clarke was one of her kindest
helpers. Several years before this, she had unwillingly
left Theodore Parker's congregation at our father's
request. She records in the "Reminiscences" his
views on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The children (our two oldest girls) are now of an
age at which they should receive impressions of reverence.
They should, therefore, see nothing at the
Sunday service which militates against that feeling. At
Parker's meeting individuals read the newspapers before
the exercises begin. A good many persons come
in after the prayer, and some go out before the conclusion
of the sermon. These irregularities offend my
sense of decorum, and appear to me undesirable in the
religious education of my family.'"</p>

<p>It was a grievous thing to her to make this sacrifice;
she said to Horace Mann that to give up Parker's
ministry for any other would be like going to the synagogue
when Paul was preaching near at hand; yet,
once made, it was the source of a lifelong joy and
comfort.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke was then preaching at Williams Hall;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
hearing Parker speak of him warmly, she determined
to attend his services. She found his preaching "as
unlike as possible to that of Theodore Parker. He
had not the philosophic and militant genius of Parker,
but he had a genius of his own, poetical, harmonizing.
In after years I esteemed myself fortunate in having
passed from the drastic discipline of the one to the
tender and reconciling ministry of the other."</p>

<p>She has much to say in the "Reminiscences" about
the dear "Saint James," as his friends loved to call
him. The relation between them was close and affectionate:
the Church of the Disciples became her spiritual
home.</p>

<p>These were the days of the Civil War; we must turn
back to its opening year to record an episode of importance
to her and to others.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1861 she went to Washington in
company with Governor and Mrs. Andrew, Mr. Clarke
and the Doctor, who was one of the pioneers of the
Sanitary Commission, carrying his restless energy and
indomitable will from camp to hospital, from battle-field
to bureau. She longed to help in some way, but
felt that there was nothing she could do&mdash;except
make lint, which we were all doing.</p>

<p>"I could not leave my nursery to follow the march
of our armies, neither had I the practical deftness
which the preparing and packing of sanitary stores
demanded. Something seemed to say to me, 'You
would be glad to serve, but you cannot help anyone:
you have nothing to give, and there is nothing for
you to do.' Yet, because of my sincere desire, a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was given me to say, which did strengthen the hearts
of those who fought in the field and of those who languished
in the prison."</p>

<p>Returning from a review of troops near Washington,
her carriage was surrounded and delayed by the
marching regiments: she and her companions sang,
to beguile the tedium of the way, the war songs which
every one was singing in those days; among them&mdash;</p>

<p>
"John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">His soul is marching on!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>The soldiers liked this, cried, "Good for you!" and
took up the chorus with its rhythmic swing.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Howe," said Mr. Clarke, "why do you not
write some good words for that stirring tune?"</p>

<p>"I have often wished to do so!" she replied.</p>

<p>Waking in the gray of the next morning, as she lay
waiting for the dawn, the word came to her.</p>

<p>
"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>She lay perfectly still. Line by line, stanza by stanza,
the words came sweeping on with the rhythm of
marching feet, pauseless, resistless. She saw the long
lines swinging into place before her eyes, heard the
voice of the nation speaking through her lips. She
waited till the voice was silent, till the last line was
ended; then sprang from bed, and groping for pen
and paper, scrawled in the gray twilight the "Battle
Hymn of the Republic." She was used to writing
thus; verses often came to her at night, and must be
scribbled in the dark for fear of waking the baby;
she crept back to bed, and as she fell asleep she said
to herself, "I like this better than most things I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
written." In the morning, while recalling the incident,
she found she had forgotten the words.</p>

<p>The poem was published in the "Atlantic Monthly"
for February, 1862. "It was somewhat praised," she
says, "on its appearance, but the vicissitudes of the
war so engrossed public attention that small heed was
taken of literary matters.... I knew and was content
to know, that the poem soon found its way to
the camps, as I heard from time to time of its being
sung in chorus by the soldiers."</p>

<p>She did not, however, realize how rapidly the hymn
made its way, nor how strong a hold it took upon the
people. It was "sung, chanted, recited, and used in
exhortation and prayer on the eve of battle." It was
printed in newspapers, in army hymn-books, on broadsides;
it was the word of the hour, and the Union
armies marched to its swing.</p>

<p>Among the singers of the "Battle Hymn" was Chaplain
McCabe, the fighting chaplain of the 122d Ohio
Volunteer Infantry. He read the poem in the "Atlantic,"
and was so struck with it that he committed
it to memory before rising from his chair. He took it
with him to the front, and in due time to Libby Prison,
whither he was sent after being captured at Winchester.
Here, in the great bare room where hundreds of
Northern soldiers were herded together, came one
night a rumor of disaster to the Union arms. A great
battle, their jailers told them; a great Confederate
victory. Sadly the Northern men gathered together
in groups, sitting or lying on the floor, talking in low
tones, wondering how, where, why. Suddenly, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the negroes who brought food for the prisoners stooped
in passing and whispered to one of the sorrowful
groups. The news was false: there had, indeed, been a
great battle, but the Union army had won, the Confederates
were defeated and scattered. Like a flame
the word flashed through the prison. Men leaped to
their feet, shouted, embraced one another in a frenzy
of joy and triumph; and Chaplain McCabe, standing
in the middle of the room, lifted up his great voice and
sang aloud,&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!"<br />
</p>

<p>Every voice took up the chorus, and Libby Prison rang
with the shout of "Glory, glory, hallelujah!"</p>

<p>The victory was that of Gettysburg. When, some
time after, McCabe was released from prison, he told
in Washington, before a great audience of loyal people,
the story of his war-time experiences; and when he
came to that night in Libby Prison, he sang the "Battle
Hymn" once more. The effect was magical: people
shouted, wept, and sang, all together; and when the
song was ended, above the tumult of applause was
heard the voice of Abraham Lincoln, exclaiming, while
the tears rolled down his cheeks,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sing it again!"</p>

<p>(Our mother met Lincoln in 1861, and was presented
to him by Governor Andrew. After greeting the party,
the President "seated himself so near the famous portrait
of Washington by Gilbert Stuart as naturally
to suggest some comparison between the two figures.
On the canvas we saw the calm presence, the serene
assurance of the man who had successfully accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a great undertaking, a vision of health and of
peace. In the chair beside it sat a tall, bony figure,
devoid of grace, a countenance almost redeemed from
plainness by two kindly blue eyes, but overshadowed
by the dark problems of the moment....</p>

<p>"When we had left the presence, one of our number
exclaimed, 'Helpless Honesty!' As if Honesty
could ever be helpless.")</p>

<p>The "Battle Hymn of the Republic" has been
translated into Italian, Spanish, and Armenian. Written
in the dark on a scrap of Sanitary Commission
paper, it has been printed in every imaginable form,
from the beautiful parchment edition presented to
the author on her seventieth birthday by the New
England Woman's Club, down to the cover of a tiny
brochure advertising a cure for consumption. It has
also been set to music many times, but never successfully.
It is inseparably wedded to the air for which it
was written, an air simple, martial, and dignified: no
attempt to divorce the two could ever succeed.</p>

<p>From the time of writing it to that of her death, she
was constantly besieged by requests for autograph
copies of part or the whole of the hymn. Sometimes
the petitioners realized what they asked, as when
Edmund Clarence Stedman wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can well understand what a Frankenstein's monster
such a creation grows to be&mdash;such a poem as the
'Battle Hymn,' when it has become the sacred scroll
of millions, each one of whom would fain obtain a copy
of it."</p>

<p>Reasonable or unreasonable, she tried to meet every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
such request; no one can ever know how many times
she copied the hymn, but if a record had been kept,
some one with a turn for multiplication might tell us
whether the lines put together made up a mile, or
more, or less.</p>

<p>She wrote many other poems of the war, among
them "The Flag," which is to be found in many anthologies.
As the "Battle Hymn" was the voice of
the nation's, so this was the expression of her own
ardent patriotism:&mdash;</p>

<p>
There's a flag hangs over my threshold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whose folds are more dear to me</span><br />
Than the blood that thrills in my bosom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Its earnest of liberty.</span><br />
<br />
And dear are the stars it harbors<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In its sunny field of blue,</span><br />
As the hope of a further Heaven<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That lights all our dim lives through.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This was no figure of speech, but the truth. The
war and its mighty issues filled her heart and mind; she
poured out song after song, all breathing the spirit of
the time, the spirit of hope, resolve, aspiration. Everything
she saw connected itself in some way with the
great struggle. Seeing her daughters among their
young friends, gay as youth must be gay, even in war-time,
she cries out,&mdash;</p>

<p>
Weave no more silks, ye Lyons looms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To deck our girls for gay delights!</span><br />
The crimson flower of battle blooms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And solemn marches fill the night.</span><br />
<br />
Weave but the flag whose bars to-day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Drooped heavy o'er our early dead,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>And homely garments, coarse and gray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For orphans that must earn their bread!<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>"The Jeweller's Shop in War-Time," "The Battle
Eucharist," "The Harvard Student's Song," all reveal
the deep feeling of her heart; we remember her singing
of "Left Behind" (set to her own music, a wild, mournful
chant) as something so thrilling that it catches the
breath as we think of it.</p>

<p>Being again in Washington in the spring of 1863, she
visited the Army of the Potomac, in company with the
wife of General Francis Barlow, and wrote on her return
a sketch of the expedition. She carried "a fine
Horace, which repeatedly annoyed me by tumbling
in the dirt, a volume of Sully's Memoirs, and a little
fag end of Spinoza, being his <i>Tractat</i> upon the Old
Testament."</p>

<p>She saw the working of the Sanitary Commission;
saw "Fighting Joe" Hooker, who looked like "the
man who can tell nineteen secrets and keep the twentieth,
which will be the only one worth knowing"; and
William H. Seward, "looking singularly like a man who
has balanced a chip on the fence, and who congratulates
himself upon its remaining there"; saw, too, from
the heights above Fredericksburg (within the danger
line!), an artillery skirmish.</p>

<p>Departing, she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Farewell, bristling heights! farewell, sad Fredericksburg!
farewell, river of sorrows; farewell, soldiers
death-determined, upon whose mournful sacrifice we
must shut unwilling eyes. Would it were all at end! the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
dead wept and buried, the living justified before God.
For the deep and terrible secret of the divine idea still
lies buried in the burning bosom of the contest. Suspected
by the few, shunned by the many, it has not
as yet leapt to light in the sight of all. This direful
tragedy, in whose third dreary act we are, hangs all
upon a great thought. To interpret this, through waste
and woe, is the first moral obligation of the situation....
This terrible development of moral causes and
effects will enchain the wonder of the world until the
crisis of poetical justice which must end it shall have
won the acquiescence of mankind, carrying its irresistible
lesson into the mind of the critics, into the heart
of the multitude."</p>

<p>PHILOSOPHY</p>

<p>
Naked and poor thou goest, Philosophy!<br />
Thy robe of serge hath lain beneath the stars;<br />
Thy weight of tresses, ponderously free,<br />
Of iron hue, no golden circlet bars.<br />
<br />
Thy pale page, Study, by thy side doth hold,<br />
As by Cyprigna's her persuasive boy:<br />
Twin sacks thou bear'st; one doth thy gifts infold,<br />
Whose modest tendering proves immortal joy.<br />
<br />
The other at thy patient back doth hang<br />
To keep the boons thou'rt wonted to receive:<br />
Reproof therein doth hide her venomed fang,<br />
And hard barbaric arts, that mock and grieve.<br />
<br />
Here is a stab, and here a mortal thrust;<br />
Here galley service brought the age to loss;<br />
Here lies thy virgin forehead rolled in dust<br />
Beside the martyr stake of hero cross.<br />
<br />
They who besmirched thy whiteness with their pitch,<br />
Thy gallery of glories did complete;<br />
They who accepted of thee so grew rich,<br />
Men could not count their treasures in the street.<br />
<br />
Thy hollow cheek, and eye of distant light,<br />
Won from the chief of men their noblest love;<br />
Olympian feasts thy temperance requite,<br />
And thy worn weeds a priceless dowry prove.<br />
<br />
I know not if I've caught the matchless mood<br />
In which impassioned Petrarch sang of thee;<br />
But this I know,&mdash;the world its plenitude<br />
May keep, so I may share thy beggary.<br />

</p>


<p><br />After the two real homes, Green Peace and Lawton's
Valley, the Chestnut Street house was nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to our hearts; this, though we were there only three
years, and though it was there that we children first
saw the face of sorrow. It was an heroic time. The
Doctor was in constant touch with the events of the
war. He was sent by Governor Andrew to examine
conditions of camps and hospitals, in Massachusetts
and at the seat of war; he worked as hard on
the Sanitary Commission, to which he had been appointed
by President Lincoln, as on any other of
his multifarious labors: his knowledge of practical
warfare and his grasp of situations gave him a foresight
of coming events which seemed well-nigh miraculous.
When he entered the house, we all felt the
electric touch, found ourselves in the circuit of the
great current.</p>

<p>So, these three years were notable for us all, especially
for our mother; for beside these vital interests,
she was entering upon another phase of development.
Heretofore her life had been domestic, studious, social;
her chief relation with the public had been through her
pen. She now felt the need of personal contact with
her audience; felt that she must speak her message.
She says in her "Reminiscences": "In the days of
which I now write, it was borne in upon me (as the
Friends say) that I had much to say to my day and
generation which could not and should not be communicated
in rhyme, or even in rhythm."</p>

<p>The character of the message, too, was changing.
In the anguish of bereavement she sought relief in
study, her lifelong resource. Religion and philosophy
went hand in hand with her. She read Spinoza eagerly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
read Fichte, Hegel, Schelling; finally, found in Immanuel
Kant a prophet and a friend. But it was
not enough for her to receive; she must also give out:
her nature was radiant. She must formulate a philosophy
of her own, and must at least offer it to the
world.</p>

<p>In September, 1863, she writes to her sister Louisa,
"My Ethics are now the joke of my family, and Flossy
or any child, wishing a second helping, will say: 'Is it
ethical, Mamma?' Too much of my life, indeed, runs
in this channel. I can only hope that the things I write
may do good to somebody, how much or how little we
ourselves are unable to measure."</p>

<p>Yet she could make fun of her philosophers: <i>vide</i>
the following passage from one of her "Tribune" letters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We like to make a clean cut occasionally, and distinguish
ourselves from our surroundings. Else, we
and they get so wedded that we scarcely know ourselves
apart. Do I own these four walls, or do they
own me, and detain me here for their pleasure and
preservation? Do I want these books, or do their
ghostly authors seize me wandering near the shelves,
impanel me by the button-hole, and insist upon pouring
their bottled-up wisdom into my passive mind? I once
read a terrible treatise of Fichte upon the <i>me and not
me</i>, in which he gave so many reasons why I could not
be the washstand, nor the washstand I, that I began
after a while to doubt the fact. Had I read further, I
think I should never have known myself from house-furniture
again. Let me here remark that many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
these gymnastics of German metaphysics seem to have
no other office than that of harmlessly emptying the
brain of all its electricity. Their battery strikes no
hammer, turns no wheel. Fichte, having decided that
he was not the washstand, smoked, took beer, and
walked out to meet some philosophic friend, who, viewing
himself <i>inclusive</i>, as the Germans say, thought he
might be that among other things. Fatherland meantime
going to the Devil&mdash;strong hands wanted, clear,
practical brains,&mdash;infinitesimal oppression to be undermined,
the century helped on. 'I am not the washstand,'
says Fichte; 'I am everything,' says Hegel.
Fatherland, take care of yourself. Yet who shall say
that it is not a vital point to know our real selves from
the factitious personalities imposed upon us, and to
distinguish between the symptoms of our fancy and
the valid phenomena of our lives?"</p>

<p>The Journal says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At 11.53 [September 24] finished my Essay on Religion,
for the power to produce which I thank God.
I believe that I have in this built up a greater coherence
between things natural and things divine than I
have seen or heard made out after this sort by anyone
else. I therefore rejoice over my work, ... hoping it
may be of service to others, as it has certainly been
to me."</p>

<p>Two days later she adds, "I leave this record of my
opinion of my work, but on reading it aloud to Paddock,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
I found the execution of the task to have fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
far short of my conception of it. I shall try to rewrite
much of the Essay."</p>

<p>The Journal of 1864 is a quarto volume, with a full
page for every day. There are many blank pages, but
the record is much fuller than heretofore.</p>

<p>"<i>January 15.</i> Worked all the afternoon at my Essay
on Distinction between Philosophy and Religion. Got
a bad feeling from fatigue. A sort of trembling agony
in my back and left side."</p>

<p>Yet she went to the opera in the evening, and saw
"Faust," a "composition with more faults than merits."
She concludes the entry with "<i>Dilige et relinque</i>
is a good motto for some things."</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday, January 17.</i> It was announced from the
pulpit that an Essay on the Soul and Body would be
read by a friend at Wednesday evening meeting. That
friend was myself, that essay my Lecture on Duality.
This would be an honor, but for my ill-deserts. Be
witness, O God! that this is no imaginary or sentimental
exclamation, but a feeling too well founded
on fact."</p>

<p>After the lecture she writes: "Mr. Clarke introduced
me charmingly. I wore my white cap, not wishing to
read in my thick bonnet. I had quite a full audience....
I consider this opportunity a great honor and
privilege conferred upon me."</p>

<p>"<i>January 28.</i> At a quarter before 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> finished
my Essay on Philosophy and Religion. I thank God
for this, for many infirmities, some physical, some
moral, have threatened to interrupt my work. It is
done, and if it is all I am to do, I am ready to die,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
since life now means work of my best sort, and I value
little else, except the comfort of my family. Now for a
little rest!"</p>

<p>The "rest" of the following day consisted in paying
eight visits between twelve and two o'clock and going
to the opera in the evening.</p>

<p>She now began to read her philosophical essays aloud
to a chosen circle of friends gathered in the parlor of
No. 13 Chestnut Street. After one of these occasions
she says: "Professor Rogers took me up sharply (not
in temper), on my first statement and definition of
Polarity. I suffered in this, but was bound to take it
in good part. A thoroughbred dog can bear to be
lifted by the ear without squealing. Endurance is a
test of breeding...."</p>

<p>"<i>May 27, 1864.</i> My birthday; forty-five years old.
This year, begun in intolerable distress, has been, I
think, the most valuable one of my life. Paralyzed
at first by Sammy's death, I soon found my only refuge
from grief in increased activity after my kind.
When he died I had written two-thirds of 'Proteus.'
As soon as I was able, I wrote the remaining portion
which treats of affection. At Newport I wrote my
Introductory Lecture on 'How <i>Not</i> to Teach Ethics,'
then 'Duality of Character,' then my first Lecture
on Religion. Returned from Newport, I wrote my
second and third essays on Religion. I read the six
essays of my first course to a large circle of friends at
my own house, not asking any payment. This done,
I began to write a long essay on Polarity which is only
partially completed, intending also to write on Limitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and the three degrees, should it be given to me to
do so. I have read and re-read Spinoza's Ethics within
the last thirteen months. His method in the arrangement
of thought and motive has been of great use to
me, but I think that I have been able to give them an
extended application and some practical illustrations
which did not lie within his scope."</p>

<p>The next day she writes: "Dreamed of dearest
Sammy. Thought that he was in the bed, and that I
was trying to nurse him in the dark as I have so often
done. I thought that when his little lips had found
my breast, something said in my ear, 'My life's life&mdash;the
glory of the world.' Quoting from my lines on
Mary Booth. This woke me with a sudden impression,
<i>Thus Nature remembers</i>."</p>

<p>She decided this spring to read some of her essays
in Washington. There were various difficulties in the
way, and she was uncertain of the outcome of the enterprise.
She writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I leave Bordentown [the home of her sister Annie]
with a resolute, not a sanguine heart. I have no one
to stand for me there, Sumner against me, Channing
almost unknown to me, everyone else indifferent. I go
in obedience to a deep and strong impulse which I do
not understand nor explain, but whose bidding I cannot
neglect. The satisfaction of having at last obeyed
this interior guide is all that keeps me up, for no one,
so far as I know, altogether approves of my going."</p>

<p>Spite of these doubts and fears, the enterprise was
successful. Perhaps people were glad to shut their
ears for a moment to the sound of cannon and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
crying of "Latest news from the front!" and listen to
the quiet words of philosophic thought and suggestion.</p>

<p>Side by side with work, as usual, went play. In
January she records the first meeting of the new club,
the "Ladies' Social," at the home of Mrs. Josiah
Quincy. This club of clever people, familiarly known
as the "Brain Club," was for many years one of her
great pleasures. Mrs. Quincy was its first president.
It may have been at this meeting that our mother,
being asked to present in a few words the nature and
object of the club, addressed the company as follows:
"Ladies and Gentlemen; this club has been formed
for the purpose of carrying on"&mdash;she paused, and
began to twinkle&mdash;"for the purpose of <i>carrying on</i>!"</p>

<p>She describes briefly a meeting of the club at 13
Chestnut Street:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Entertained my Club with two charades. <i>Pan-demon-ium</i>
was the first, <i>Catastrophe</i> the second. For
<i>Pan</i> I recited some verses of Mrs. Browning's 'Dead
Pan,' with the gods she mentions in the background,
my own boy as Hermes. For 'Demon' I had a female
Faust and a female Satan. Was aided by Fanny McGregor,
Alice Howe, Hamilton Wilde, Charles Carroll,
and James C. Davis, with my Flossy, who looked
beautifully. The entertainment was voted an entire
success."</p>

<p>We remember these charades well. The words</p>

<p>
"Aphrodite, dead and driven<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As thy native foam thou art ... "</span><br />
</p>

<p>call up the vision of Fanny McGregor, white and beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
lying on a white couch in an attitude of perfect
grace.</p>

<p>We hear our mother's voice reciting the stately
verses. We see her as the "female Faust," first bending
over her book, then listening entranced to the
promises of Mephistopheles, finally vanishing behind
a curtain from which the next instant sprang Florence
(the one child who resembled her) in all the gayety of
her bright youth.</p>

<p>The next day she was, "Very weary all day. Put
things to rights as well as I could. Read in Spinoza,
Cotta, and Livy."</p>

<p>It was for the Brain Club that she wrote "The Socio-Maniac,"
a cantata caricaturing fashionable society.
She set the words to music, and sang with much solemnity
the "Mad Song" of the heroine whose brain
had been turned by too much gayety:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Her mother was a Shaw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her father was a Tompkins;</span><br />
Her sister was a bore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her brother was a bumpkin;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! Soci&mdash;oh! Soci&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! Soci&mdash;e&mdash;ty!</span><br />
<br />
"Her flounces were of gold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her slippers were of ermine;</span><br />
And she looked a little bold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she rose to lead the Germin;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! Soci&mdash;oh! Soci&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! Soci&mdash;e&mdash;ty!</span><br />
<br />
"For my part I never saw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where she kept her fascination;</span><br />
But I thought she had an aw-<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ful conceit and affectation;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! Soci&mdash;oh! Soci&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! Soci&mdash;e&mdash;ty!"</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>New interests were constantly arising. In these days
Edwin Booth made his first appearance in Boston.
Our mother and father went to the Boston Theatre
one rainy evening, "expecting to see nothing more
than an ordinary performance. The play was 'Richelieu,'
and we had seen but little of Mr. Booth's part
in it before we turned to each other and said, 'This
is the real thing!'"</p>

<p>Then they saw him in "Hamlet" and realized even
more fully that a star had risen. He seemed</p>

<p>
... beautiful as dreams of maidenhood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That doubt defy,</span><br />
Young Hamlet, with his forehead grief-subdued,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And visioning eye.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Booth's manager asked her to write a play for
the young tragedian. She gladly consented; Booth
himself came to see her; she found him "modest, intelligent,
and above all genuine,&mdash;the man as worthy
of admiration as the artist."</p>

<p>In all the range of classic fiction, to which her mind
naturally turned, no character seemed to fit him so
well as that of Hippolytus; his austere beauty, his
reserve and shyness, all seemed to her the personification
of the hunter-prince, beloved of Artemis, and
she chose this theme for her play.</p>

<p>The writing of "Hippolytus" was accomplished
under difficulties. She says of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had at this time and for many years afterward
a superstition about a north light. My eyes had given
me some trouble, and I felt obliged to follow my literary
work under circumstances most favorable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
their use. The exposure of our little farmhouse [at
Lawton's Valley] was south and west, and its only
north light was derived from a window at the top of
the attic stairs. Here was a platform just large enough
to give room for a table two feet square. The stairs
were shut off from the rest of the house by a stout door.
And here, through the summer heats, and in spite of
many wasps, I wrote my five-act drama, dreaming of
the fine emphasis which Mr. Booth would give to its
best passages and of the beautiful appearance he would
make in classic costume. He, meanwhile, was growing
into great fame and favor with the public, and was
called hither and thither by numerous engagements.
The period of his courtship and marriage<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> intervened,
and a number of years elapsed between the completion
of the play and his first reading of it."</p>

<p>At last the time seemed ripe for the production
of the play. E. L. Davenport, the actor manager of the
Howard Athenæum, agreed to produce it: Charlotte
Cushman was to play Phædra to Booth's Hippolytus.
Rehearsals began, the author's dream seemed close
upon fulfilment. Then came a slip never fully explained:
the manager suddenly discovered that the
subject of the play was a painful one; other reasons
were given, but none that appeared sufficient to author
or actors.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Miss Cushman, "if Edwin Booth
and I had done nothing more than stand upon the
stage and say 'good evening' to each other, the house
would have been filled."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>Briefly, the play was withdrawn. Our mother says:
"This was, I think, the greatest 'let down' that I
ever experienced. It affected me seriously for some
days, after which I determined to attempt nothing
more for the stage."</p>

<p>She never forgot the play nor her bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>Many memories cluster about the gracious figure of
Edwin Booth. He came often&mdash;for so shy and retiring
a man&mdash;to the Chestnut Street house. We children
all worshipped at his shrine; the elder girls worked his
initials on the under side of the chair in which he once
sat, which was thereafter like no other chair; the
younger ones gazed in round-eyed admiration, but
the great man had eyes for one only of us all. We gave
a party for him, and Beacon Street came in force to
meet the brilliant young actor. Alas! the brilliant
young actor, after the briefest and shyest of greetings
to the company, retired into a corner with eight-year-old
Maud, where he sat on the floor making dolls and
rabbits out of his pocket handkerchief!</p>

<p>This recalls an oft-quoted anecdote of the time.
Our mother wished Charles Sumner to see and know
Booth. One evening when the Senator was at the
house, she told him of her wish. The next day she
writes in her Journal: "Sumner to tea. Made a rude
speech on being asked to meet Booth. Said: 'I don't
know that I should care to meet him. I have outlived
my interest in individuals.' Fortunately, God Almighty
had not, by last accounts, got so far."</p>

<p>Sumner was told of this in her presence. "What a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
strange sort of book," he exclaimed, "your diary must
be! You ought to strike that out immediately."</p>

<p>She admired Charles Sumner heartily, but they disagreed
on many points. He disapproved of women's
speaking in public (as did the Doctor), and&mdash;with
wholly kind intentions&mdash;did what he could to prevent
her giving the above-mentioned readings in
Washington. She notes this in her Journal.</p>

<p>"I wrote him a very warm letter, but with no injurious
phrase, as I felt only grief and indignation, not
dis-esteem, towards him. Yet the fact of having written
the letter became extremely painful to me, when it
was once beyond recall. I could not help writing a
second on the day following, to apologize for the roughness
of the first. This was a diplomatic fault, I think,
but one inseparable from my character. C.S.'s reply,
which I dreaded to read, was very kind. While I
clearly saw his misapprehension of the whole matter,
I saw also the thorough kindliness and sincerity of his
nature. So we disagree, but I love him."</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner did not attend the readings, but he came
to see her, and was, as always, kind and friendly. After
seeing him in the Senate she writes: "Sumner looks
up and smiles. That smile seems to illuminate the
Senate."</p>

<p>Another passage in the Journal of March, 1864,
is in a different note: "Maggie ill and company to
dinner. I washed breakfast things, cleared the table,
walked, read Spinoza a little, then had to 'fly round,'
as my dinner was an early one. Picked a grouse, and
saw to various matters. Company came, a little early.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
The room was cold. Hedge, Palfrey, and Alger to
dinner. Conversation pleasant, but dinner late, and
not well served. Palfrey and Hedge read Parker's
Latin epitaph on Chev, amazed at the bad Latinity."</p>


<p><br />In June, 1864, a Russian squadron, sent to show
Russia's good-will toward the United States, dropped
anchor in Boston Harbor, and hospitable Boston rose
up in haste to receive the strangers. Dr. Holmes
wrote a song beginning,&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Seabirds of Muscovy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rest in our waters,"&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>which was sung to the Russian national air at a public
reception.</p>

<p>Our mother for once made no "little verse," but she
saw a good deal of the Russian officers; gave parties
for them, and attended various functions and festivities
on board the ships. On Sunday, June 22, she
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To mass on board the Oslaba.... The service was
like the Armenian Easter I saw in Rome.... It is a
sacrifice to God instead of a lesson from Him, which
after all makes the difference between the old religions
and the true Christian. For even Judaism is
heathen compared with Christianity. Yet I found this
very consoling, as filling out the verities of religious
development. I seemed to hear in the responses a great
harmony in which the first man had the extreme bass
and the last born babe the extreme treble. Theo.
Parker and my dear Sammy were blended in it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>Soon after this the "seabirds of Muscovy" departed;
then came the flitting to Newport, and a summer of
steady work.</p>

<p>"Read Paul in the Valley. Thought of writing a
review of his first two epistles from the point of view
of the common understanding. The clumsy Western
mind has made such literal and material interpretations
of the Oriental finesses of the New Testament,
that the present coarse and monstrous beliefs, so far
behind the philosophical, æsthetic, and natural culture
of the age, is imposed by the authority of the few
upon the ignorance of the many, and stands a monument
of the stupidity of all.</p>

<p>"Paul's views of the natural man are, inevitably,
much colored by the current bestiality of the period.
To apply his expressions to the innocent and inevitable
course of Nature is coarse, unjust, and demoralizing,
because confusing to the moral sense."</p>

<p>"I came to the conclusion to-day that an heroic intention
is not to be kept in sight without much endeavor.
Now that I have finished at least one portion
of my Ethics and Dynamics, I find myself thinking
how to get just credit for it, rather than how to make
my work most useful to others. The latter must, however,
be my object, and shall be. Did not Chev so discourage
it, I should feel bound to give these lectures
publicly, being, as they are, a work for the public. I
do not as yet decide what to do with them."</p>

<p>Returning to 13 Chestnut Street, she found a multiplicity
of work awaiting her. Ethics had to stand aside
and make way for Poetry and Philanthropy. New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
York was to celebrate the seventieth birthday of William
Cullen Bryant; she was asked to write a poem for
the occasion. This she did joyfully, composing and
arranging the stanzas mostly in the train between
Newport and Boston.</p>

<p>On the day of the celebration, she took an early
train for New York: Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes was
on the train. "I will sit by you, Mrs. Howe," he said,
"but I must not talk! I am going to read a poem at
the Bryant celebration, and must save my voice."</p>

<p>"By all means let us keep silent," she replied. "I also
have a poem to read at the Bryant Celebration."</p>

<p>Describing this scene she says, "The dear Doctor,
always my friend, overestimated his power of abstinence
from the interchange of thought which was so
congenial to him. He at once launched forth in his
own brilliant vein, and we were within a few miles of
our destination when we suddenly remembered that
we had not taken time to eat our luncheon."</p>

<p>George Bancroft met them at the station, carried
her trunk himself ("a small one!"), and put her into his
own carriage. The reception was in the Century Building.
She entered on Mr. Bryant's arm, and sat between
him and Mr. Bancroft on the platform. The
Journal tells us:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After Mr. Emerson's remarks my poem was announced.
I stepped to the middle of the platform, and
read my poem. I was full of it, and read it well, I
think, as every one heard me, and the large room
was crammed. The last two verses&mdash;not the best&mdash;were
applauded.... This was, I suppose, the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
public honor of my life. I record it for my grandchildren."</p>

<p>The November pages of the Journal are blank, but
on that for November 21 is pasted a significant note.
It is from the secretary of the National Sailors' Fair,
and conveys the thanks of the Board of Managers to
Mrs. Howe "for her great industry and labor in editing
the 'Boatswain's Whistle.'"</p>

<p>Neither Journal nor "Reminiscences" has one word
to say about fair or paper; yet both were notable. The
great war-time fairs were far more than a device for
raising money. They were festivals of patriotism; people
bought and sold with a kind of sacred ardor. This
fair was Boston's contribution toward the National
Sailors' Home. It was held in the Boston Theatre,
which for a week was transformed into a wonderful
hive of varicolored bees, all "workers," all humming
and hurrying. The "Boatswain's Whistle" was the
organ of the fair. There were ten numbers of the
paper: it lies before us now, a small folio volume of
eighty pages.</p>

<p>Title and management are indicated at the top of
the first column:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>Each member of the Council made at least one contribution
to the paper; but the burden fell on the Editor's
shoulders. She worked day and night; no wonder
that the pages of the Journal are blank. Beside
the editorials and many other unsigned articles, she
wrote a serial story, "The Journal of a Fancy Fair,"
which brings back vividly the scene it describes. In
those days the raffle was not discredited. Few people
realized that it was a crude form of gambling; clergy
and laity alike raffled merrily. Our mother, however,
in her story speaks through the lips of her hero a
pungent word on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The raffle business is, I suppose, the great humbug
of occasions of this kind. It seems to me very
much like taking a front tooth from a certain number
of persons in order to make up a set of teeth for a
party who wants it and who does not want to pay
for it."</p>

<p>We should like to linger over the pages of the "Boatswain's
Whistle"; to quote from James Freeman
Clarke's witty dialogues, Edward Everett's stately
periods, Dr. Holmes's sparkling verse; to describe
General Grant, the prize ox, white as driven snow and
weighing 3900 pounds, presented by the owner to
President Lincoln and by him to the fair. Did we not
see him drawn in triumph through Boston streets on
an open car, and realize in an instant&mdash;fresh from
our "Wonder-Book"&mdash;what Europa's bull looked
like?</p>

<p>But of all the treasures of the little paper, we must
content ourselves with this dispatch:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Allow me to wish you a great success. With the old
fame of the navy made bright by the present war, you

To all, from Rear Admiral to honest Jack, I tender
the nation's admiration and gratitude.</p>

<h3>THE WIDER OUTLOOK</h3>

<h4>1865; <i>aet.</i> 46</h4>

<p>THE WORD</p>

<p>
Had I one of thy words, my Master,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a spirit and tone of thine,</span><br />
I would run to the farthest Indies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To scatter the joy divine.</span><br />
<br />
I would waken the frozen ocean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a billowy burst of joy:</span><br />
Stir the ships at their grim ice-moorings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The summer passes by.</span><br />
<br />
I would enter court and hovel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgetful of mien or dress,</span><br />
With a treasure that all should ask for,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An errand that all should bless.</span><br />
<br />
I seek for thy words, my Master,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a spelling vexed and slow:</span><br />
With scanty illuminations<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In an alphabet of woe.</span><br />
<br />
But while I am searching, scanning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A lesson none ask to hear,</span><br />
My life writeth out thy sentence<br />

</p>


<p><br />The war was nearly over, and all hearts were with
Grant and Lee in their long duel before Richmond.
Patriotism and philosophy together ruled our mother's
life in these days; the former more apparent in her
daily walk among us, the latter in the quiet hours with
her Journal.</p>

<p>The Journal for 1865 is much fuller than that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
1864; the record of events is more regular, and we find
more and more reflection, meditation, and speculation.
The influence of Kant is apparent; the entries become
largely notes of study, to take final shape in lectures
and essays.</p>

<p>"A morning visit received in study hours is a sickness
from which the day does not recover. I can neither
afford to be idle, nor to have friends who are so."</p>

<p>"Man is impelled by inward force, regulated by outward
circumstance. He is inspired from within, moralized
from without.... A man may be devout in himself,
but he can be moral only in his relation with other
men...."</p>

<p>"Early to Mary Dorr's, to consult about the Charade.
Read Kant and wrote as usual. Spent the afternoon
in getting up my costumes for the Charade.
The word was Au-thor-ship.... Authorship was expressed
by my appearing as a great composer, Jerry
Abbott performing my Oratorio&mdash;a very comical
thing, indeed. The whole was a success."</p>

<p>No one who saw the "Oratorio" can forget it. Mr.
Abbott, our neighbor in Chestnut Street, was a comedian
who would have adorned any stage. The "book"
of the Oratorio was a simple rhyme of Boston authorship.</p>

<p>
"Abigail Lord,<br />
Of her own accord,<br />
Went down to see her sister,<br />
When Jason Lee,<br />
As brisk as a flea,<br />
He hopped right up and kissed her."<br />
</p>

<p>With these words, an umbrella, and a chair held before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
him like a violoncello, Mr. Abbott gave a truly
Handelian performance. Fugue and counterpoint, first
violin and bass tuba, solo and full chorus, all were rendered
with a <i>verve</i> and spirit which sent the audience
into convulsions of laughter.&mdash;This was one of the
"carryings-on" of the Brain Club. After another such
occasion our mother writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very weary and aching a little. I must keep out of
these tomfooleries, though they have their uses. They
are much better than some other social entertainments,
as after all they present some æsthetic points of interest.
They are better than scandal, gluttony, or wild
dancing. But the artists and I have still better things
to do."</p>

<p>"<i>January 23.</i> It is always legitimate to wish to rise
above one's self, never above others. In this, however,
as in other things, we must remember the maxim:
'<i>Natura nil facit per saltum</i>.' All true rising must be
gradual and laborious, in such wise that the men of to-morrow
shall look down almost imperceptibly upon the
men of to-day. All sudden elevations are either imaginary
or factitious. If you had not a kingly mind before
your coronation, no crown will make a king of you. The
true king is somewhere, starving or hiding, very like.
For the true value which the counterfeit represents
exists somewhere. The world has much dodging about
to produce the real value and escape the false one."</p>

<p>Throughout the Journal, we find a revelation of the
conflict in this strangely dual nature. Her study was,
she thought, her true home; yet no one who saw her in
society would have dreamed that she was making an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
effort: <i>nor was she</i>! She gave herself up entirely to
the work or the play of the hour. She was a many-sided
crystal: every aspect of life met its answering
flash. The glow of human intercourse kindled her to
flame; but when the flame had cooled, the need of
solitude and study lay on her with twofold poignancy.
She went through life in double harness, thought and
feeling abreast; though often torn between the two,
in the main she gave free rein to both, trusting the
issue to God.</p>

<p>The winter of 1864-65 was an arduous one. She
was writing new philosophical essays, and reading
them before various circles of friends. The larger audience
which she craved was not for the moment attainable.
She was studying deeply, reading Latin by
way of relaxation, going somewhat into society (Julia
and Florence being now of the dancing age), and entertaining
a good deal in a quiet way. In February she
writes: "Much tormented by interruptions. Could not
get five quiet minutes at a time. Everybody torments
me with every smallest errand. And I am trying to
study philosophy!"</p>

<p>Probably we were troublesome children and made
more noise than we should. Her accurate ear for music
was often a source of distress to her, as one of us can
witness, an indolent child who neglected her practising.
As this child drummed over her scales, the door of the
upstairs study would open, and a clear voice come ringing
down, "<i>B flat</i>, dear, <i>not</i> B natural!"</p>

<p>It seemed to the child a miracle; she, with the book
before her, could not get it right: "Mamma," studying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Kant upstairs behind closed doors, knew what the note
should be.</p>

<p>"Few of us consider the wide and laborious significance
of the simplest formulas we employ. 'I love
you!' opens out a long vista of labor and endeavor;
otherwise it means: 'I love myself and need you.'..."</p>

<p>"Played all last evening for Laura's company to
dance. My heart flutters to-day. It is a feeling unknown
to me until lately."</p>

<p>Now, Laura would have gone barefoot in snow to
save her mother pain or fatigue; yet she has no recollection
of ever questioning the inevitability of "Mamma's"
playing for all youthful dancing. Grown-up
parties were different; for them there were hired musicians,
who made inferior music; but for the frolics of
the early 'teens, who <i>should</i> play except "Mamma"?</p>

<p>On March 10, she writes: "I have now been too long
in my study. I must break out into real life, and learn
some more of its lessons."</p>

<p>Two days later a lesson began: "I stay from church
to-day to take care of Maud, who is quite unwell.
This is a sacrifice, although I am bound and glad
to make it. But I shall miss the church all the
week."</p>

<p>The child became so ill that "all pursuits had to be
given up in the care of her." The Journal gives a minute
account of this illness, and of the remedies used,
among them "long-continued and gentle friction with
the hand." The words bring back the touch of her
hand, which was like no other. There were no trained
nurses in our nursery, rarely any doctor save "Papa,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
but "Mamma" rubbed us, and that was a whole
pharmacop&oelig;ia in itself.</p>

<p>At this time she gave her first public lecture before
the Parker Fraternity. This was an important event
to her; she had earnestly desired yet greatly dreaded
it. She found the hall pleasant, the audience attentive.
"When I came to read the lecture," she says, "I felt
that it had a value."</p>

<p>"All these things in my mind point one way, viz.:
towards the adoption of a profession of Ethical exposition,
after my sort."</p>

<p>She had been asked to give a lecture at Tufts College,
and says of this: "The difficulties are great, the
question is to me one of simple duty. If I am sent for,
and have the word to say, I should say it."</p>

<p>And again: "I determine that I can only be good in
fulfilling my highest function&mdash;all else implies waste
of power, leading to demoralization."</p>

<p>She declined the invitation, "feeling unable to decide
in favor of accepting it."</p>

<p>"But I was sorry," she says, "and I remembered
the words: 'He that hath put his hand to the plough
and looketh back is not fit for the kingdom of heaven.'
God keep me from so looking back!"</p>

<p>The Journal of this spring is largely devoted to
philosophic speculations and commentaries on Kant,
whose theories she finds more and more luminous and
convincing; now and then comes a note of her own:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I am God!' says the fool. 'I see God!' says the
wise man. For while you are your own supreme, you
are your own God, and self-worship is true atheism."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>"It is better to use a bad man by his better side
than a good man by his worse side."</p>

<p>"Christ said that he was older than Abraham. I
think that he used this expression as a measure of
value. His thoughts were further back in the primal
Ideal necessity. He did not speak of any personal life
antedating his own existence.... In his own sense,
Christ was also newer than we are, for his doctrine is
still beyond the attainment of all and the appreciation
of most of us."</p>

<p>"There is no essential religious element in negation."</p>

<p>"Saw Booth in 'Hamlet'&mdash;still first-rate, I think,
although he has played it one hundred nights in New
York. 'Hamlet' is an æsthetic Evangel. I know of
no direct ethical work which contains such powerful
moral illustration and instruction."</p>

<p>"James Freeman [Clarke] does not think much of
Sam's book, probably not as well as it deserves. But
the knowledge of Sam's personality is the light behind
the transparency in all that he does."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>These were the closing months of the Civil War. All
hearts were lifted up in thankfulness that the end
was near. She speaks of it seldom, but her few words
are significant.</p>

<p>"<i>Monday, April 3....</i> Richmond was taken this
morning. <i>Laus Deo!</i>"</p>

<p>On April 10, after "Maud's boots, $3.00, Vegetables,
.12, Bread, .04," we read, "Ribbons for victory, .40.
To-day we have the news of Lee's surrender with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
whole remnant of his army. The city is alive with
people. All flags hung out&mdash;shop windows decorated&mdash;processions
in the street. All friends meet and
shake hands. On the newspaper bulletins such placards
as '<i>Gloria in excelsis Deo</i>,' 'Thanks be to God!'
We all call it the greatest day of our lives.</p>

<p>"Apples, half-peck, .50."</p>

<p>That week was one of joy and thankfulness for all.
Thursday was Fast Day; she "went to church to
fatigue Satan. Afterwards made a visit to Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;
who did not seem to have tired her devil out."</p>

<p>The joy bells were soon to be silenced. Saturday,
April 15, was</p>

<p>"A black day in history, though outwardly most
fair. President Lincoln was assassinated in his box
at the theatre, last evening, by J. Wilkes Booth. This
atrocious act, which was consummated in a very theatrical
manner, is enough to ruin not the Booth family
alone, but the theatrical profession. Since my Sammy's
death, nothing has happened that has given me so
much personal pain as this event. The city is paralyzed.
But we can only work on, and trust in
God."</p>

<p>Our father's face of tragedy, the anguish in his voice,
as he called us down to hear the news, come vividly
before us to-day, one of the clearest impressions of
our youth. Our mother went with him next day to
hear Governor Andrew's official announcement of the
murder to the Legislature, and heard with deep emotion
his quotation from "Macbeth":&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Besides, this Duncan</span><br />
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been<br />
So clear in his great office, that his virtues<br />
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against<br />
The deep damnation of his taking-off," etc.<br />
</p>

<p>Wednesday, April 19, was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The day of President Lincoln's funeral. A sad,
disconnected day. I could not work, but strolled
around to see the houses, variously draped in black
and white. Went to Bartol's church, not knowing of
a service at our own. Bartol's remarks were tender and
pathetic. I was pleased to have heard them.</p>

<p>"Wrote some verses about the President&mdash;pretty
good, perhaps,&mdash;scratching the last nearly in the
dark, just before bedtime."</p>

<p>This is the poem called "Parricide." It begins:&mdash;</p>

<p>
O'er the warrior gauntlet grim<br />
Late the silken glove we drew.<br />
Bade the watch-fires slacken dim<br />
In the dawn's auspicious hue.<br />
Staid the armèd heel;<br />
Still the clanging steel;<br />
Joys unwonted thrilled the silence through.<br />
</p>

<p>On April 27 she "heard of Wilkes Booth's death&mdash;shot
on refusing to give himself up&mdash;the best thing
that could have happened to himself and his family";
and wrote a second poem entitled "Pardon," embodying
her second and permanent thought on the subject:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Pains the sharp sentence the heart in whose wrath it was uttered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Now thou art cold;</span><br />
Vengeance, the headlong, and Justice, with purpose close muttered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Loosen their hold, etc.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Brief entries note the closing events of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>"<i>May 13.</i> Worked much on Essay.... In the
evening said to Laura: 'Jeff Davis will be taken to-morrow.'
Was so strongly impressed with the thought
that I wanted to say it to Chev, but thought it was too
silly."</p>

<p>"<i>May 14.</i> The first thing I heard in the morning
was the news of the capture of Jeff Davis. This made
me think of my preluding the night before...."</p>


<p><br />Other things beside essays demanded work in these
days. The great struggle was now over, and with it
the long strain on heart and nerve, culminating in the
tragic emotion of the past weeks. The inevitable reaction
set in. Her whole nature cried out for play, and
play meant work.</p>

<p>"Working all day for the Girls' Party, to-morrow
evening. Got only a very short reading of Kant, and
of Tyndall. Tea with the Bartols. Talk with [E. P.]
Whipple, who furiously attacked Tacitus. Bartol and
I, who know a good deal more about him, made a
strong fight in his behalf."</p>

<p>"Working all day for the Party. The lists of men
and women accepting and declining were balanced by
my daughter F. with amusing anxiety.... The two
sexes are now neck and neck. Dear little Maud was
in high glee over every male acceptance. Out of all
this hubbub got a precious forty-five minutes with
Kant...."</p>

<p>The party proved "very gay and pleasant."</p>

<p>Now came a more important event: the Musical
Festival celebrating the close of the war, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
was given by the Handel and Haydn Society, at its
semi-centennial, in May, 1865. Our mother sang alto
in the chorus. The Journal records daily, sometimes
semi-daily, rehearsals and performances, Kant
squeezed to the wall, and getting with difficulty his
daily hour or half-hour. Mendelssohn's "Hymn of
Praise" and "Elijah"; Haydn's "Creation," Handel's
"Messiah" and "Israel in Egypt"; she sang in
them all.</p>

<p>Here is a sample Festival day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Attended morning rehearsal, afternoon concert,
and sang in the evening. We gave 'Israel in Egypt'
and Mendelssohn's 'Hymn of Praise.' I got a short
reading of Kant, which helped me through the day.
But so much music is more than human nerves can
respond to with pleasure. This confirms my belief in
the limited power of our sensibilities in the direction
of pure enjoyment. The singing in the choruses fatigues
me less than hearing so many things."</p>

<p>After describing the glorious final performance of
the "Messiah," she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So farewell, delightful Festival! I little thought
what a week of youth was in store for me. For these
things carried me back to my early years, and their
passion for music. I remembered the wholeness with
which I used to give myself up to the concerts and
oratorios in New York, and the intense reaction of
melancholy which always followed these occasions."</p>

<p>And the next day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Still mourning the Festival a little. If I had kept
up my music as I intended, in my early youth, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
never have done what I have done&mdash;should never
have studied philosophy, nor written what I have
written. My life would have been more natural and
passionate, but I think less valuable. Yet I cannot
but regret the privation of this element in which I
have lived for years. But I do believe that music is
the most expensive of the fine arts. It uses up the
whole man more than the other arts do, and builds
him up less. It is more passional, less intellectual, than
the other arts. Its mastery is simple and absolute,
while that of the other arts is so complex as to involve
a larger sphere of thought and reflection. I have observed
the faces of this orchestra just disbanded. Their
average is considerably above the ordinary one. But
they have probably more talent than thought."</p>

<p>On May 31 we find a significant entry. The evening
before she had attended the Unitarian Convention, and
"heard much tolerable speaking, but nothing of any
special value or importance." She now writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I really suffered last evening from the crowd of
things which I wished to say, and which, at one word
of command, would have flashed into life and, I think,
into eloquence. It is by a fine use of natural logic that
the Quaker denomination allows women to speak,
under the pressure of religious conviction. 'In Christ
Jesus there is neither male nor female,' is a good
sentence. Paul did not carry this out in his church
discipline, yet, one sees, he felt it in his religious contemplation.
I feel that a woman's whole moral
responsibility is lowered by the fact that she must
never obey a transcendent command of conscience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Man can give her nothing to take the place of this. It
is the <i>divine</i> right of the human soul."</p>

<p>The fatigue and excitement of the Festival had to
be paid for: the inevitable reaction set in.</p>

<p>"<i>June 3.</i> Decidedly I have spleen in these days.
Throughout my whole body, I feel a mingled restlessness
and feebleness, as if the nerves were irritated, and
the muscles powerless. I feel puzzled, too, about the
worth of what I have been doing for nearly three years
past. There is no one to help me in these matters. I
determine still to work on and hope on. Much of the
work of every life is done in the dark."</p>

<p>Again: "Spleen to-day, and utter discouragement.
The wind is east, and this gives me the strange feeling,
described before, of restlessness and powerlessness. My
literary affairs are in a very confused state. I have no
market. This troubles me.... God keep me from falling
away from my purpose, to do only what seems to
me necessary and called for in my vocation, and not to
produce for money, praise, or amusement."</p>

<p>"Was melancholy and Godless all day, having
taken my volume of Kant back to the Athenæum for
the yearly rearrangement. Could not interest myself
in anything.... Visited old Mrs. Sumner,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> whose
chariot and horses are nearly ready."</p>

<p>At this time there was some question of selling
Lawton's Valley for economic reasons. The exigency
passed, but the following words show the depth of her
feeling on the subject: "If I have any true philosophy,
any sincere religion, these must support me under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
privation of the Valley. I feel this, and resolve to do
well, but nature will suffer. That place has been my
confidante,&mdash;my bosom friend,&mdash;intimate to me
as no human being ever will be&mdash;dear and comforting
also to my children...."</p>

<p>"<i>June 11....</i> Thought of a good text for a sermon,
'In the world ye shall have tribulation,' the scope being
to show that our tribulation, if we try to do well, is
in the world, our refuge and comfort in the church.
Thought of starting a society in Newport for the practice
of sacred music, availing ourselves of the summer
musicians and the possible aid of such ladies as Miss
Reed, etc., for solos. Such an enterprise would be
humanizing, and would supply a better object than the
empty reunions of fashion...."</p>

<p>"<i>Wednesday, June 21.</i> Attended the meeting at
Faneuil Hall, for the consideration of reconstruction
of the Southern States. Dana made a statement to
the effect that voting was a civic, not a natural, right,
and built up the propriety of negro suffrage on the
basis first of military right, then of duty to the negro,
this being the only mode of enabling him to protect
himself against his late master. His treatment was
intended to be exhaustive, and was able, though cold
and conceited. Beecher tumbled up on the platform
immediately after, not having heard him, knocked
the whole question to pieces with his great democratic
power, his humor, his passion, and his magnetism. It
was Nature after Art, and his nature is much greater
than Dana's art."</p>

<p>A few days after this she writes: "... Sumner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the evening&mdash;a long and pleasant visit. He is a very
sweet-hearted man, and does not grow old."</p>

<p>The Musical Festival had not yet exacted full arrears
of payment; she was too weary even to enjoy the
Valley at first; but after a few days of its beloved seclusion
she shook off fatigue and was herself again,
reading Kant and Livy, teaching the children, and
gathering mussels on the beach.</p>

<p>She flits up to town to see the new statue of Horace
Mann, "in order to criticise it for Chev's pamphlet";<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
meets William Hunt, who praises its simplicity and
parental character; and Charles Sumner, who tells
her it looks better on a nearer view.</p>

<p>The day after&mdash;"we abode in the Valley, when three
detachments of company tumbled in upon us, to wit,
Colonel Higginson and Mrs. McKay, the Tweedys
and John Field, and the Gulstons. All were friendly.
Only on my speaking of the rudeness occasionally
shown me by a certain lady, Mrs. Tweedy said: 'But
that was in the presence of your superiors, was it not?'
I replied: 'I do not know that I was ever in Mrs. X.'s
company under those circumstances!' After which
we all laughed."</p>

<p>She was at this time sitting to Miss Margaret Foley
for a portrait medallion and was writing philosophy
and poetry. Family and household matters also
claimed their share of attention.</p>

<p>"Finished reading over 'Polarity' [her essay]. Reading
to the children, 'Foxes have holes, and birds of the
air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to lay his head'&mdash;my little Maud's eyes filled with
tears."</p>

<p>"Much worried by want of preparedness for today's
picnic. Managed to get up three chickens killed
on short notice, a pan of excellent gingerbread, two
cans of peaches, and a little bread and butter. Went
in the express wagon.... At the picnic I repeated my
Cambridge poem, ... and read 'Amanda's Inventory'
and my long poem on Lincoln's death.... Duty depends
on an objective, happiness upon a subjective,
sense. The first is capable of a general and particular
definition, the second is not."</p>

<p>"In the afternoon mended Harry's shirt, finished
Maud's skirt, read Livy and Tyndall, and played
croquet, which made me very cross."</p>

<p>"Exhumed my French story and began its termination.
Mended a sheet badly torn."</p>

<p>After a long list of purchases&mdash;</p>

<p>"Worked like a dog all day. Went in town, running
about to pick up all the articles above mentioned....
Came home&mdash;cut bread and butter and spread sandwiches
till just within time to slip off one dress and
slip on another. My company was most pleasant,
and more numerous than I had anticipated...."</p>

<p>"Legal right is the universal compulsion which secures
universal liberty."</p>

<p>"I feel quite disheartened when I compare this summer
with the last. I was so happy and hopeful in
writing my three Essays and thought they should open
such a vista of usefulness to me, and of good to others.
But the opposition of my family has made it almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
impossible for me to make the use intended of them.
My health has not allowed me to continue to produce
so much. I feel saddened and doubtful of the value of
what I have done or can do...."</p>

<p>"<i>August 23....</i> Rights and duties are inseparable
in human beings. God has rights without duties. Men
have rights and duties. If a slave have not rights, he
also has not duties...."</p>

<p>"With the girls to a matinée at Bellevue Hall. They
danced and I was happy."</p>

<p>"My croquet party kept me busy all day. It was
pleasant enough...."</p>

<p>"... 'My peace I give unto you' is a wonderful
saying. What peace have most of us to give each other?
But Christ has given peace to the world, peace at
least as an ideal object, to be ever sought, though
never fully attained."</p>

<p>"<i>September 10....</i> Read Kant on state rights.
According to him, wars of conquest are allowable only
in a state of nature, not in a state of peace (which is
not to be attained without a compact whose necessity
is supreme and whose obligations are sacred). So
Napoleon's crusade against the constituted authority
of the European republic was without logical justification,&mdash;which
accounts for the speedy downfall of
his empire. What he accomplished had only the subjective
justification of his genius and his ambition.
His work was of great indirect use in sweeping away
certain barriers of usage and of superstition. He drew a
picture of government on a large scale and thus set a
pattern which inevitably enlarged the procedures of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
successors, who lost through him the prestige of divine
right and of absolute power. But the inadequacy of
his object showed itself through the affluence of his
genius. The universal dominion of the Napoleon family
was not to be desired or endured by the civilized
world at large. The tortoise in the end overtook the
hare, and slow, plodding Justice, with her loyal hack,
distanced splendid Ambition mounted on first-rate
ability, once and forever...."</p>

<p>"To Zion church, to hear &mdash;&mdash; preach. Text, 'Son,
remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy
good things.' Sermon as far removed from it as
possible, weak, sentimental, and illiterate. He left
out the 'd' in 'receivedst,' and committed other errors
in pronunciation. But to sit with the two aunts<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> in
the old church, so familiar to my childhood, was touching
and impressive. Hither my father was careful to
bring us. Imperfect as his doctrine now appears to
me, he looks down upon me from the height of a better
life than mine, and still appears to me as my
superior."</p>

<p>"A little nervous about my reading. Reached Mrs.
[Richard] Hunt's at twelve. Saw the sweet little
boy. Mrs. Hunt very kind and cordial. At one Mr.
Hunt led me to the studio which I found well filled,
my two aunts in the front row, to my great surprise;
Bancroft, too, quite near me. I shortened the essay
somewhat. It was well heard and received. Afterwards
I read my poem called 'Philosophy,' and was
urged to recite my 'Battle Hymn,' which I did. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
much gratified by the kind reception I met with and
the sight of many friends of my youth. A most pleasant
lunch afterwards at Mrs. Hunt's, with Tweedys,
Tuckermans, and Laura."</p>

<p>"I see no outlook before me. So many fields for
activity, but for passivity, which seems incumbent
upon me, only uselessness, obscurity, deterioration.
Some effort I must make."</p>

<p>Many efforts were impending, though not precisely
in the direction contemplated. First, a new abode
must be found for the winter, as the owners of 13
Chestnut Street claimed it for themselves. She and
the Doctor added house-hunting to their other burdens,
and found it a heavy one. On October 6 she
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Much excited about plans and prospects. Chev
has bought the house in Boylston Place.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> God grant
it may be for the best. Determine to have classes
in philosophy, and to ask a reasonable price for my
tickets....</p>

<p>"The Sunday's devotion without the week's thought
and use is a spire without a meeting-house. It leaps
upward, but crowns and covers nothing.</p>

<p>"I have too often set down the moral weight I have
to carry, and frisked around it. But the voice now tells
me that I must bear it to the end, or lose it forever."</p>

<p>The move to Boylston Place was in November.
Early in the month a "frisking" took place, with
amusing results. Our mother went with Governor
and Mrs. Andrew and a gay party to Barnstable for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
annual festival and ball. The Ancient and Honorable
Artillery Company acted as escort, and&mdash;according
to custom&mdash;the band of the Company furnished the
music. For some reason&mdash;the townspeople thought
because the pretty girls were all engaged beforehand
for the dance&mdash;the officer in command stopped the
music at twelve o'clock, to the great distress of the
Barnstable people who had ordered their carriages
at two or later. The party broke up in disorder far
from "admired," and our mother crystallized the
general feeling in the following verses, which the
Barnstableites promptly printed in a "broadside,"
and sang to the then popular tune of "Lanigan's
Ball":&mdash;</p>


<p>THE BARNSTABLE BALL</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Lyric</span></p>

<p>(<i>Appointed to be sung in all Social Meetings on the Cape</i>)</p>

<p>
March away with your old artillery;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Don't come back till we give you a call.</span><br />
Put your Colonel into the pillory;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He broke up the Barnstable Ball.</span><br />
<br />
Country folks don't go a-pleasuring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every day, as it doth befall;</span><br />
They with deepest scorn are measuring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Him who broke up the Barnstable Ball.</span><br />
<br />
He came down with his motley company,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stalking round the 'cultural hall;</span><br />
Couldn't find a partner to jump any,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So broke up the Barnstable Ball.</span><br />
<br />
Warn't it enough with their smoking and thundering,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweeping about like leaves in a squall,</span><br />
But they must take to theft and plundering,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Steal the half of the Barnstable Ball?</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>Put the music into their pocket,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Order the figure-man not to bawl,</span><br />
Twenty jigs were still on the docket,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they adjourned the Barnstable Ball.</span><br />
<br />
Gov'nor A. won't hang for homicide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That's a point that bothers us all;</span><br />
He must banish ever from his side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such as murdered the Barnstable Ball.</span><br />
<br />
When they're old and draw'd with rheumatiz,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let them say to their grandbabes small,</span><br />
"Deary me, what a shadow of gloom it is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To remember the Barnstable Ball!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>This autumn saw the preparation of a new volume
of poems, "Later Lyrics." Years had passed since the
appearance of "Words for the Hour," and our mother
had a great accumulation of poems, the arrangement
of which proved a heavy task.</p>

<p>"The labor of looking over the manuscript nearly
made me ill.... Had a new bad feeling of intense
pressure in the right temple."</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nearly disabled by headaches.... Determine to
push on with my volume."</p>

<p>"Almost distracted with work of various sorts&mdash;my
book&mdash;the new house&mdash;this one full of company,
and a small party in the evening."</p>

<p>"All these days much hurried by proofs. Went in
the evening to the opening of the new wards in the
Women's Hospital&mdash;read two short poems, according
to promise. These were kindly received...."</p>

<p>The next day she went with a party of friends to
the Boys' Reform School at Westboro. "In the yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
where the boys were collected, the guests were introduced.
Quite a number crowded to see the Author of
the 'Battle Hymn.' Two or three said to me: 'Are
you the woman that wrote that "Battle Hymn"?'
When I told them that I was, they seemed much
pleased. This I felt to be a great honor."</p>

<p>The next day again she is harassed with correcting
proofs and furnishing copy. "Ran to Bartol for a little
help, which he gave me."</p>

<p>The Reverend C. A. Bartol was our next-door neighbor
in Chestnut Street, a most kind and friendly one.
His venerable figure, wrapped in a wide cloak, walking
always in the middle of the road (we never knew why
he eschewed the sidewalk), is one of the pleasant memories
of Chestnut Street. We were now to leave that
beloved street; a sorrowful flitting it was.</p>

<p>"<i>Friday, November 3.</i> Moving all day. This is my
last writing in this dear house, No. 13 Chestnut Street,
where I have had three years of good work, social and
family enjoyment. Here I enjoyed my dear Sammy
for six happy months&mdash;here I mourned long and bitterly
for him. Here I read my six lectures on Practical
Ethics. Some of my best days have been passed in
this house. God be thanked for the same!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>NO. 19 BOYLSTON PLACE: "LATER LYRICS"</h3>

<h4>1866; <i>aet.</i> 47</h4>

<p>IN MY VALLEY</p>

<p>
From the hurried city fleeing,<br />
From the dusty men and ways,<br />
In my golden sheltered valley,<br />
Count I yet some sunny days.<br />
<br />
Golden, for the ripened Autumn<br />
Kindles there its yellow blaze;<br />
And the fiery sunshine haunts it<br />
Like a ghost of summer days.<br />
<br />
Walking where the running water<br />
Twines its silvery caprice,<br />
Treading soft the leaf-spread carpet,<br />
I encounter thoughts like these:&mdash;<br />
<br />
"Keep but heart, and healthful courage,<br />
Keep the ship against the sea,<br />
Thou shalt pass the dangerous quicksands<br />
That ensnare Futurity;<br />
<br />
"Thou shalt live for song and story,<br />
For the service of the pen;<br />
Shalt survive till children's children<br />
Bring thee mother-joys again.<br />
<br />
"Thou hast many years to gather;<br />
And these falling years shall bring<br />
The benignant fruits of Autumn,<br />
Answering to the hopes of Spring.<br />
<br />
"Passing where the shades that darken<br />
Grow transfigured to thy mind,<br />
Thou shalt go with soul untroubled<br />
To the mysteries behind;<br />
<br />
"Pass unmoved the silent portal<br />
Where beatitude begins,<br />
With an equal balance bearing<br />
Thy misfortunes and thy sins."<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>Treading soft the leaf-spread carpet,<br />
Thus the Spirits talked with me;<br />
And I left my valley, musing<br />
On their gracious prophecy.<br />
<br />
To my fiery youth's ambition<br />
Such a boon were scarcely dear;<br />
"Thou shalt live to be a grandame,<br />
Work and die, devoid of fear."<br />
<br />
"Now, as utmost grace it steads me,<br />
Add but this thereto," I said:<br />
"On the matron's time-worn mantle<br />
Let the Poet's wreath be laid."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">J. W. H.</span><br />
</p>


<p><br />"My first writing in the new house, where may God
help and bless us all. May no dark action shade our
record in this house, and if possible, no surpassing
sorrow."</p>

<p>After the wide sunny spaces of No. 13 Chestnut
Street, the new house seemed small and dark; nor was
Boylston Place even in those days a specially cheerful
<i>cul de sac</i>; yet we remember it pleasantly enough
as the home of much work and much play.</p>

<p>"<i>November 19.</i> Had the comforts of faith from dear
James Freeman [Clarke] to-day. Felt restored to
something like the peace I enjoyed before these two
tasks of printing and moving broke up all leisure and
all study. Determined to hold on with both hands to
the largeness of philosophical pursuit and study, and
to do my utmost to be useful in this connection and
path of life...."</p>

<p>"Comforting myself with Hedge's book. Determined
to pass no more godless days...."</p>

<p>She began to read Grote's Plato, and the Journal
contains much comment on the Platonic philosophy.
Another interest which came to her this autumn was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
that of singing with the Handel and Haydn Society.
She and Florence joined the altos, while "Harry,"
then in college (Harvard, 1869), sang bass. We find
her also, in early December, rehearsing with a small
chorus the Christmas music for the Church of the
Disciples, and writing and rehearsing a charade for
the Club.</p>

<p>"<i>December 12.</i> Saw my new book at Tilton's. It
looks very well, but I am not sanguine about its
fate."</p>

<p>"Later Lyrics" made less impression than either of
the earlier volumes. It has been long out of print; our
mother does not mention it in her "Reminiscences";
even in the Journal, the book once published, there are
few allusions to it, and those in a sad note: "Discouraged
about my book," and so forth; yet it contains
much of her best work.</p>

<p>"<i>December 16.</i> Sarah Clarke<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and Foley<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> are to dine
with me at 5.30. Went out at 10 A.M. to take Foley to
see [William] Hunt, whom we found in his studio in
a queer knitted coat. He showed an unfinished head
of General Grant, in which it struck me that the eyes
looked like the two scales of a balance in which men
and events could be weighed."</p>

<p><br />The Journal for 1866 opens with a Latin aspiration:
"<i>Quod bonus, felix, faustusque sit hic annus mihi et
meis amicis dilectis et generi humano!</i>"</p>

<p>February finds her in New York, going to a "family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
party at Aunt Maria's.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Uncle John came. He was
the eldest, my Harry the youngest member. I made
a charade, <i>Shoddy</i>, in which Mary [Ward] and Flossy
took part. Mary did very well. Flossy always does
well. I enjoyed this family gathering more than anything
since leaving home. It is so rare a pleasure
for me. Family occasions are useful in bringing people
together on the disinterested ground of natural affection,
without any purpose of show or self-advancement.
Relations should meet on more substantial ground than
that of fashion and personal ambition. Nature and
self-respect here have the predominance. In my youth
I had no notion of this, though I always clung to those
of my own blood."</p>

<p>From New York she went to Washington, where she
gave a series of philosophical readings. Here, while
staying at the house of Mrs. Eames, she had a violent
attack of malarial fever, but struggled up again
with her usual buoyancy.</p>

<p>"<i>February 19.</i> Weather rainy, so stayed at home;
eyes weak, so could do little but lie in my easy-chair,
avoid cold, and hang on to conversation. To-day the
President<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> vetoed the bill for the Freedmen's Bureau.
The reading of the veto was received by the Senate
with intense, though suppressed, excitement. Governor
Andrew read it to us. It was specious, and ingeniously
overstated the scope and powers demanded for the
Bureau, in order to make its withholdment appear a
liberal and democratic measure. Montgomery Blair
is supposed to have written this veto."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p><p>At her first reading, she had "an excellent audience.
The rooms were well filled and there were many men
of note there.... Governor Andrew brought me in.
Sam Hooper was there. I read 'The Fact Accomplished.'
They received it very well. I was well
pleased with my reception."</p>

<p>The next day she was so weary that she fell asleep
while the Marquis de Chambrun was talking to her.</p>


<p><br />"<i>February 23.</i> To-day we learned the particulars
of President Johnson's disgraceful speech, which
awakens but one roar of indignation. To the Senate
at 11.30. When the business hour is over, Fessenden
moves the consideration of the House Resolution proposing
the delay in the admission of members for the
Southern States until the whole South shall be in a
state for readmission. Sherman, of Ohio, moves the
postponement of the question, alleging the present
excitement as a reason for this. (He probably does
this in the Copperhead interest.) At this Fessenden
shows his teeth and shakes the Ohio puppy pretty well.
Howe of Wisconsin also speaks for the immediate discussion
of the question. Doolittle, of &mdash;&mdash;, speaking
against it, Trumbull calls him to order. Reverdy
Johnson pitches in a little. The Ayes and Noes are
called for and the immediate consideration receives a
good majority. Fessenden now makes his speech,
reads the passage from the President's speech, calling
the committee of fifteen a directory,&mdash;comments fully
on the powers of Congress, the injustice of the President
and his defiant attitude.... He has force as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
debater, but no grasp of thought.... In the evening
I read the first half of 'Limitations' to a very small
circle. A Republican caucus took all the members
of Congress. Garrison also lectured. I was sorry,
but did my best and said, 'God's will be done.' But I
ought to have worked harder to get an audience."</p>

<p>"<i>February 25....</i> Rode with Lieber<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> as far as Baltimore.
He heard Hegel in his youth and thinks him,
as I do, decidedly inferior to Kant, morally as well as
philosophically....</p>

<p>"The laws and duties of society rest upon a supposed
compact, but this compact cannot deprive any
set of men of rights and limit them to duties, for if
you refuse them all rights, you deprive them even of
the power to become a party to this compact, which
rests upon their right to do so. Our slaves had no
rights. Women have few."</p>


<p><br />After leaving Washington, she spent several days
with her sister Annie in Bordentown, and there
and in New York gave readings which seem to have
been much more successful than those in Washington.
After the New York reading she is "glad and thankful."</p>

<p>The visits in Bordentown were always a delight and
refreshment to her. She and her "little Hitter"
frolicked, once more two girls together: e.g., the following
incident:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Reverend &mdash;&mdash; Bishop was the Mailliards'
pastor; a kindly gentleman, who could frolic as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
another. One day our Aunt Annie, wishing to ask him
to dine, sat down at her desk and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"My dear Mr. Bishop,<br />
To-day we shall dish up<br />
At one and a half<br />
The hind leg of a calf&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>At this point she was called away on household business.
Our mother sat down and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Now B., if he's civil,<br />
May join in our revel;<br />
But if he is not,<br />
He may go to the devil!"<br />
</p>

<p>During the days that followed, Kant and charades
divided her time pretty evenly.</p>

<p>"Kant's 'Anthropologia' is rather trifling, after his
great works. I read it to find out what Anthropology
is."</p>
<p>
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *
</p>
<p>"Good is a direction; virtue is a habit."</p>
<p>
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />
</p>
<p>"Wearied by endless running about to find help for
my charade, &mdash;&mdash; having disappointed me. Determine
to undertake nothing more of the kind."</p>
<p>
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />
</p>
<p><br />The charade (<i>Belabor</i>), which came off the following
evening, was marked by a comic "To be or not to be,"
composed and recited by her in a "Hamlet costume,
consisting of a narrow, rather short black skirt, a long
black cloak and a black velvet toque, splendid lace
ruff, amethyst necklace. It was very effective, and
the verses gave reasonable pleasure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>"<i>March 15....</i> Went to the Masonic Banquet,
which was preceded by a long ceremony, the consecration
of three new banners. The forms were curious,
the music good, the occasion unique. The association
appeared to me a pale ghost of knighthood, and the
solemnities a compromise between high mass and dress
parade. The institution now means nothing more than
a military and religious toy."</p>


<p><br />In this year she met with a serious loss in the death
of her uncle, John Ward. He had been a second father
to her and her sisters; his kindly welcome always made
No. 8 Bond Street a family home.</p>

<p>"<i>April 4.</i> The contents of uncle's will are known
to-day. He had made a new one, changing the disposition
of his property made in a previous will which
would have made my sisters and me much richer. This
one gives equally to my cousins, Uncle William's four
sons, and to us; largely to Uncle Richard, and most
kindly to Brother Sam and Wardie. We know not
why this change was made, but once made, it must
be acquiesced in, like other events past remedy. My
cousins are wealthy already&mdash;this makes little difference
to them, but much to us. God's will be done,
however. I must remember my own doctrine, and
build upon 'The Fact Accomplished.'"</p>

<p>This passage explains the financial worries which,
from now on, often oppressed her. She was brought up
in wealth and luxury; sober wealth, unostentatious
luxury, but enough of both to make it needless for her
ever to consider questions of ways and means. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
whole family, from the adoring father down to the
loving youngest sister, felt that she must be shielded
from every sordid care or anxiety; she was tended like
an orchid, lest any rough wind check her perfect
blossoming.</p>

<p>Her father left a large fortune, much of which was
invested in blocks of real estate in what is now the heart
of New York. Uncle John, best and kindest of men,
had no knowledge of real estate and none of the foresight
which characterized his elder brother. After Mr.
Ward's death, he made the mistake of selling out the
Manhattan real estate, and investing the proceeds in
stocks and bonds. Later, realizing his grave error, he
resolved to mitigate the loss to his three nieces by
dividing among them the bulk of his property.</p>

<p>This failing, the disappointment could not but be a
sensible one, even to the least money-loving of women.
The Doctor's salary was never a large one: the children
must be given every possible advantage of education
and society; no door that was open to her own youth
should be closed to them; again, to entertain their
friends (albeit in simple fashion), to respond to every
call of need or distress, was matter of necessity to both
our parents: small wonder that they were often pressed
for money. All through the Journals we find this note
of financial anxiety: not for herself, but for her children,
and later for her grandchildren. She accepted
the restricted means; she triumphed over them, and
taught us to hold such matters of little account compared
with the real things of life; but they never ceased
to bewilder her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>Yet to-day, realizing of what vital importance this
seeming misfortune was to her; how but for this, her
life and other lives might have lacked "the rich flavor
of hope and toil"; how but for this she might have
failed to lock hands with humanity in a bond as close
as it was permanent, who can seriously regret Uncle
John's devastating yet fruitful mistake?</p>

<p>In April again she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dull, sad and perplexed. My uncle not having
made me a rich woman, I feel more than ever impelled
to make some great effort to realize the value of my
mental capacities and acquisitions. I am as well entitled
to an efficient literary position as any woman
in this country&mdash;perhaps better than any other. Still
I hang by the way, picking up ten dollars here and
there with great difficulty. I pray God to help me to
an occasion or sphere in which I may do my utmost.
I had as lief die as live unless I can be satisfied that I
have delivered the whole value of my literary cargo&mdash;all
at least that was invoiced for this world. Hear me,
great Heaven! Guide and assist me. No mortal can."</p>

<p>The next day's entry is more cheerful.</p>

<p>"Feel better to-day. Made the acquaintance of
Aldrich and Howells and their wives, at Alger's last
evening. I enjoyed the evening more than usual.
Aldrich has a very refined face. Howells<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> is odd-looking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
but sympathetic and intelligent. Alger was in all
his glory."</p>


<p>"<i>April 11....</i> Between a man governed by inner
and one governed by outer control, there is the difference
which we find between a reptile in a shell and a
vertebrate. The one has his vertebræ within to support
him, the other has them without to contain him."</p>

<p>"<i>April 19.</i> Very busy all day. Ran about too much,
and was very tired. Had friends, in the evening, to
meet young Perabo. I did not wish to give a party,
on account of Uncle's death, but could not help getting
together quite a lovely company of friends. Aldrich
and wife were here, Alger, Bartol, Professor Youmans,
Perabo, Dresel, Louisa D. Hunt, and others. It was
a good time.... Saw my last cent go&mdash;nothing now
till May, unless I can earn something."</p>

<p>"<i>April 20.</i> Began to work over and correct my poem
for the Church Festival, which must be licked into
shape, for the Gods will give me none other. So I must
hammer at it slowly, and a good deal.... To write
purely for money is to beg, first telling a story."</p>

<p>In these days the Doctor was very weary through
excess of work. He longed for a change, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
have been glad to receive the mission to Greece, of
which some prospect had been held out to him. She
writes: "Chev full of the Greek mission, which I
think he cannot get. I wish he might, because he
wishes it. Surely a man so modest and meritorious
in his public career might claim so small an acknowledgment
as this. But as we are, he represents Charity,
I the study of Philosophy&mdash;we cannot be more
honored than by standing for these things."</p>

<p>It was thought that she might have some influence
in obtaining the mission: accordingly she went to
Washington, anxious to help if she might. She saw the
President of the Senate, who promised support. While
there she writes: "Governor Andrew took me to General
Grant's, where I saw the General, with great satisfaction.
Prayed at bedtime that I might not become a
superficial sham and humbug."</p>

<p>Hearing that Charles Sumner had sought her at the
house of Mrs. Eames, she sent a message to him by a
common friend. She writes: "Sumner cannot make
a visit at the hotel, but will see me at the Capitol. I
know of nothing which exempts a man in public life
from the duty of having, in private, some <i>human</i>
qualities." Mr. Sumner did come to see her later,
when she was staying with Mrs. Eames. She saw Secretary
Seward, who was very ungracious to her; and
President Johnson, whom she found "not one inclined
to much speech." Before the latter interview her
prayer was: "Let me be neither unskilful nor mean!"</p>

<p>The visit to Mrs. Eames was a sad one, being at the
time of the death of Count Gurowski, a singular man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
whom she has described in her "Reminiscences"; but
she met many notable persons, and had much interesting
conversation with her host and hostess. She
records one or two bits of talk.</p>

<p>"Mr. Eames saying that Mrs. X. was an intelligent
but not an original woman, I said: 'She is not a silk-worm,
but a silk-wearer!' Nine women out of ten
would rather be the latter than the former."</p>

<p>"Mr. Eames saying that he often talked because he
could not make the effort to be silent, I said: 'Yes, sir;
we know that the <i>vis inertiæ</i> often shows itself in
motion.'</p>

<p>"I record these sayings," she adds, "because they interested
me, opening to myself little shades of thought
not perceived before."</p>


<p><br />"<i>May 27.</i> Boston. My birthday. Forty-seven years
old. J. F. C. preached on 'The seed is the word,' and
gave a significant statement of the seminal power of
Christianity. They sang also a psalm tune which I like,
so that the day (a rainy one) seems to me auspicious.
I have little to show for the past year's work, having
produced no work of any length and read but little in
public. The doctrine of the <i>seed</i> does, however, encourage
us to continue our small efforts. The most
effectual quickening of society is through that small
influence which creeps like the leaven through the
dough...."</p>

<p>"... Roman piety was the duteous care of one's
relatives. It follows from this that the disregard of
parents and elders common in America is in itself an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
irreligious trait, and one which education should sedulously
correct."</p>

<p>On May 29 she attended the Unitarian Festival.
She recalls the fact that at the last festival she was
"tormented by the desire to speak. But I am now
grown more patient, knowing that silence also is
valuable...."</p>

<p>The Chevalier was not to receive the only reward
he had ever sought for his labors. On May 31 she
writes: "To-day the blow fell. A kind letter from Vice-President
Foster informed me that Charles T. Tuckerman
had been nominated for the Greek mission. This
gave me an unhappy hour. Chev was a good deal
overcome by it for a time, but rallied and bears up
bravely. The girls are rather glad. I am content, but
I do not see what can take the place of this cherished
object to Chev...."</p>

<p>The following verses embody her thoughts on this
matter:&mdash;</p>

<p>To S. G. H.</p>

<p class="center"><i>On his failure to receive the Grecian mission which he had been led
to think might be offered to him. 1866.</i></p>

<p>
The Grecian olives vanish from thy sight,<br />
The wondrous hills, the old historic soil;<br />
The elastic air, that freshened with delight<br />
Thy youthful temples, flushed with soldier toil.<br />
<br />
O noble soul! thy laurel early wreathed<br />
Gathers the Christian rose and lilies fair,<br />
For civic virtues when the sword was sheathed,<br />
And perfect faith that learns from every snare.<br />
<br />
Let, then, the modern embassy float by,<br />
Nor one regret in thy high bosom lurk:<br />
God's mission called thy youth to that soft sky;<br />
Wait God's dismissal where thou build'st His work!<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>"<i>Divide et impera</i> is an old maxim of despotism
which does not look as if States' rights pointed in the
direction of true freedom."</p>

<p>"It is only in the natural order that the living dog
is better than the dead lion. Will any one say that
the living thief is better than the dead hero? No one,
save perhaps the thief himself, who is no judge."</p>

<p>The Journal is now largely concerned with Kant,
and with Maine's work on "Ancient Law," from which
she quotes freely. Here and there are touches of her
own.</p>

<p>"Epicureans are to Stoics as circumference to
centre."</p>

<p>"I think Hegel more difficult than important. Many
people suppose that the difficulty of a study is a sure
indication of its importance."</p>

<p>In these years the Doctor and our sister Julia were
in summer time rather visitors than members of the
family. The former was, as Governor Bullock said
of him, "driving all the Charities of Massachusetts
abreast," and could enjoy the Valley only by snatches,
flying down for a day or a week as he could. Julia, from
her early girlhood, had interested herself deeply in all
that concerned the blind, and had become more and
more the Doctor's companion and workfellow at the
Perkins Institution, where much of his time was necessarily
spent. She had classes in various branches of
study, and in school and out gave herself freely to her
blind pupils. A friend said to her mother, many years
later, "It was one of the sights of Boston in the days
of the Harvard Musical concerts to see your Julia's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
radiant face as she would come into Music Hall, leading
a blind pupil in either hand."</p>

<p>Early in this summer of 1866 Julia accompanied the
Doctor on a visit to the State Almshouse at Monson,
and saw there a little orphan boy, some three years
old, who attracted her so strongly that she begged to be
allowed to take him home with her. Accordingly she
brought him to the Valley, a sturdy, blue-eyed Irish
lad. Julia, child of study and poetry, had no nursery
adaptability, and little "Tukey" was soon turned over
to our mother, who gladly took charge of him. He was
nearly of the age of her little Sammy: something in his
countenance reminded her of the lost child, and she
found delight in playing with him. She would have
been glad to adopt him, but this was not thought practicable.
Julia had already tired of him; the Doctor for
many reasons advised against it.</p>

<p>She grieved all summer for the child; but was afterward
made happy by his adoption into a cheerful and
prosperous home.</p>

<p>This was a summer of arduous work. The "Tribune"
demanded more letters; Kant and Maine could not be
neglected, and soon Fichte was added to them.</p>

<p>Moreover, the children must have every pleasure
that she could give them.</p>

<p>"Worked hard all the morning for the croquet party
in the afternoon, which was very pleasant and successful.</p>

<p>"Took Julia to the party on board the Rhode Island.
She looked charmingly, and danced. I was quite happy
because she enjoyed it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>Early August found her in Northampton, reporting
for the "Tribune" the Convention of the American
Academy of Science. The Doctor and Julia joined her,
and she had "very busy days," attending the sessions
and writing her reports.</p>

<p>"Read over several times my crabbed essay on the
'Two Necessities,' which I determine to read in the
evening. I have with me also the essay on 'Limitations,'
far more amusing and popular. But for a scientific
occasion, I will choose a treatise which aims at
least at a scientific treatment of a great question. This
essay asserts the distinctness of the Ideal Order and its
legitimate supremacy in human processes of thought.
I make a great effort to get its points thoroughly in
my mind. Go late to the Barnards'. The scientifics
arrive very late, Agassiz gets there at 9. I begin to
read soon after. The ladies of our party are all there.
I feel a certain enthusiasm in my work and subject,
but do not communicate it to the audience, which
seemed fatigued and cold; all at least but Pierce,
Agassiz, and Davis. Had I done well or ill to read it?...
Some soul may have carried away a seed-grain
of thought."</p>

<p>"<i>August 11....</i> To Mount Holyoke in the afternoon.
The ascent was frightful, the view sublime. In
the evening went to read to the insane people at the
asylum; had not 'Later Lyrics,' but 'Passion Flowers.'
Read from this and recited from the other. Had great
pleasure in doing this, albeit under difficulties. Finished
second 'Tribune' letter and sent it."</p>

<p>Back at the Valley, she plunges once more into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Fichte; long hours of study, varied by picnics and
sailing parties.</p>

<p>"To church at St. Mary's. X. preached. The beginning
of his sermon was liberal,&mdash;the latter half sentimental
and sensational. 'The love of Christ constraineth
us,' but he dwelt far too much on the supposition
of a personal and emotional relation between the soul
and Christ. It is Christian doctrine interpreted by
human sympathy that reclaims us. Christ lives in his
doctrine, influences us through that, and his historical
personality. All else is myth and miracle. What Christ
is to-day ideally we may be able to state, of what he is
really, Mr. X. knows no more than I do, and I know
nothing.</p>

<p>"Stayed to Communion, which was partly pleasant.
But the Episcopal Communion struck me as dismal,
compared to our own. It is too literal and cannibalistic;&mdash;the
symbolism of the eating and drinking is too
little made out. Our Unitarian Communion is a feast of
joy. The blessedness of Christ's accomplishment swallows
up the sorrow of his sacrifice. We have been
commemorating the greatest act and fact of human
history, the initiation of the gentler morals of the purer
faith. We are glad,&mdash;not trivially, but solemnly, and
our dear Master is glad with us, but not as if he aimed
a direct personal influence at each one of us. This is
too human and small a mode of operation.</p>

<p>"He is there for us as the sun is there and the brightness
of his deed and doctrine penetrates the recesses of
our mind and consciousness. But that he knows each
one of us cannot and need not be affirmed.</p>

<p>"I yesterday spoke to Joseph Coggeshall, offering to
give a reading at the schoolhouse, in order to start a

proposed to ask .50 for each ticket."</p>

<p>"Chev suggests Europe. '<i>Je suis content du palazzo

<p>"I cannot study Fichte for more than forty-five
minutes at a time. Reading him is not so bad as translating,
which utterly overpowers my brain, although
I find it useful in comprehending him."</p>

<p>"I begin to doubt the availability of Fichte's methods
for me. I become each day more dispirited over
him. With the purest intention he is much less of an
ethicist than Kant. These endless refinements in <i>rationale</i>
of the <i>ego</i> confuse rather than enlighten the
moral sense. Where the study of metaphysics becomes
de-energizing, it becomes demoralizing. Subtlety
used in a certain way unravels confusion, in a
certain other way produces it. Kant unwinds the silkworm's
web, but Fichte tangles the skein of silk,&mdash;at
least so it seems to me.</p>

<p>"Spent most of the afternoon in preparing for a tea
party, cutting peaches and preparing bread and
butter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>"Read 11th and 12th chapters of Mark in the Valley.
At some moments one gets a clearer and nearer perception

than that which we commonly carry with us."</p>

<p>Early in October came the move "home to Boylston
Place, leaving the Valley with great regret, but feeling
more the importance of being with the children, as I
draw nearer to them."</p>

<p>Our mother had remained after the rest of us, to
close the house. In Boston she had the great pleasure
of welcoming to this country her nephew, Francis
Marion Crawford, then a boy of twelve years. Born
and bred in Rome, a beautiful and petted child, he was
now to learn to be an American schoolboy. She took
him herself to St. Paul's School in Concord, New
Hampshire; and for a year or two he spent most of his
holidays with us, to the delight of us all.</p>

<p>In this autumn of 1866 she undertook a new task, of
which the first mention in the Journal reads: "I will
here put the names of some writers of stories whom I
may employ for the magazine."</p>

<p>A list of writers follows: and the next day she writes:
"I saw J. R. Gilmour and agreed with him to do editorial
service for thirty dollars per week for three
months."</p>

<p>This magazine was the "Northern Lights." The
first number appeared in January, 1867. It contained
two articles by Mrs. Howe: the "Salutation" and a
thoughtful poem called "The Two R's" (Rachel and
Ristori). Later, we find her in the "Sittings of the Owl
Club," making game of the studies she loved.</p>

<p>The "Northern Lights" gleam fitfully in the
Journal.</p>

<p>"<i>October 26.</i> To write Henry James for story,
Charles T. Brooks for sketches of travel. Saw and
talked with Gilmour, who confuses my mind."</p>

<p>"<i>October 29.</i> Chev went with me to Ristori's <i>début</i>,
which was in Medea."</p>

<p>"<i>November 3.</i> All of these days have been busy and
interrupted. Maggi<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> has been reading Ristori's plays
in my parlor every day this week and my presence has
been compulsory. I have kept on with Fichte whose
'<i>Sittenlehre</i>' I have nearly finished. Have copied one
or two poems, written various letters in behalf of the
magazine, have seen Ristori thrice on the stage and
once in private."</p>

<p>"<i>November 10.</i> Finished copying and correcting my
editorial for the first number of my weekly. Finished
also Fichte's '<i>Sittenlehre</i>' for whose delightful reading
I thank God, praying never to act quite unworthily
of its maxims."</p>

<p>"<i>November 11.</i> Called on Mrs. Charles Sumner, and
saw both parties, who were very cordial and seemed
very happy."</p>

<p>"<i>November 15.</i> Crackers, .25, eggs, .43, rosewater
for Frank Crawford, .48. Very weary and overdone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
The twelve apostles shall judge the twelve tribes in
that the Christian doctrine judges the Jews.</p>

<p>"I lead a weary life of hurry and interruption."</p>

<p>"<i>November 18.</i> Weary hearts must, I think, be idle
hearts, for it is cheery even to be overworked. My
studies and experience have combined to show me the
difficulty of moral attainment, but both have made me
feel that with every average human being there is a
certain possible conjunction of conviction, affection,
and personality which, being effected, the individual
will see the reality of the ethical aspects of life and the
necessary following of happiness upon a good will and
its strenuous prosecution.</p>

<p>"I began Fichte's '<i>Wissenschaftslehre</i>' two or three
days ago.</p>

<p>"Gave a small party to Baron Osten Sacken....
Peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must, makes the
difference between the beggar and the thief."</p>

<p>"<i>November 26.</i> Very unwell; a good day's work,
nevertheless."</p>

<p>"<i>November 27.</i> Better. Last week was too fatiguing
for a woman of my age. I cannot remember my forty-seven
years, and run about too much. The oratorio
should, I fear, be given up."</p>

<p>"<i>December 8.</i> I came in from Lexington last night
after the reading<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> in an open buggy with a strange
driver, a boy of eighteen, who when we were well under
way showed me a pistol,&mdash;a revolver, I think,&mdash;and
said that he never travelled at night without one. As
the boy's very face was unknown to me, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
adventure seemed bizarre. He brought me home to my
own house.... Am writing on 'Representation.'...
Man asks nothing so much as to be helped to self-control."</p>

<p>"<i>December 9.</i> Heard J. F. C. as usual. 'She hath
done what she could'&mdash;a good text for me at this
moment. Independently of ambition, vanity, pride,&mdash;all
of which prompt all of us, I feel that I must do what
my hand finds to do, taking my dictation and my
reward from sources quite above human will and approbation."</p>

<p>"<i>December 19....</i> Vicomte de Chabreuil came. We
had a long, and to me splendid, conversation. Were I
young this person would occupy my thoughts somewhat.
Very intelligent, simple, and perfectly bred,
also a <i>rosso</i>,&mdash;a rare feature in a Frenchman."</p>

<p>"<i>December 27.</i> Let me live until to-morrow, and not
be ridiculous! I have a dinner party and an evening
party to-day and night, and knowing myself to be a
fool for my pains, am fain to desire that others may
not find it out and reproach me as they discover it.</p>

<p>"Got hold of Fichte a little which rested my weary
brain.</p>

<p>"My party proved very pleasant and friendly."</p>

<p>"<i>December 29....</i> I read last night at the Club a
poem, 'The Rich Man's Library,' which contrasts material
and mental wealth, much to the disparagement
of the former. I felt as if I ought to read it, having
inwardly resolved never again to disregard that inner
prompting which leaves us no doubt as to the authority
of certain acts which present themselves to us for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
accomplishment. Having read the poem, however, I
felt doubtful whether after all I had done well to read it
in that company. I will hope, however, that it may
prove not to have been utterly useless. The imperfection
of that which we try to do well sometimes reacts
severely upon us and discourages us from further effort.
It should not."</p>

<p>"<i>December 31.</i> Ran about all day, but studied and
wrote also.</p>

<p>"Farewell, old Diary, farewell, old Year! Good,
happy and auspicious to me and mine, and to mankind,
I prayed that you might be, and such I think you have
been. To me you have brought valued experience and
renewed study. You have introduced me to Fichte,
you have given me the honor of a new responsibility,
you have made me acquainted with some excellent
personages, among them Baron McKaye, a youth of
high and noble nature; Perabo, an artist of real genius....
You have taught me new lessons of the true meaning
and discipline of life,&mdash;the which should make me
more patient in all endurance, more strenuous in all
endeavor. You have shown me more clearly the line of
demarcation between different talents, pursuits, and
characters. So I thank and bless your good days, looking
to the Supreme from whom we receive all things.
The most noticeable events of the year just passed, so
far as I am concerned, are the following: the invitation
received by me to read at the Century Club in New
York. This reading was hindered by the death of my
brother-in-law, J. N. Howe. The death of dear Uncle
John. My journey to Washington to get Chev the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Greek appointment. Gurowski's death. Attendance
at the American Academy of Science at Northampton
in August. The editorship of the new weekly. My
study of Fichte's '<i>Sittenlehre</i>' and the appearance of
my essay on the 'Ideal State' in the 'Christian Examiner.'
My reading at Lexington for the Monument
Association. My being appointed a delegate from the
Indiana Place Church to the Boston Conference of
Unitarian and other Christian Churches. My readings
at Northampton, Washington, and elsewhere are all
set down in their place. The bitter opposition of my
family renders this service a very difficult and painful
one for me. I do not, therefore, seek occasions of performing
it, not being quite clear as to the extent to
which they ought to limit my efficiency; but when the
word and the time come together I always try to give
the one to the other and always shall. God instruct
whichever of us is in the wrong about this. And may
God keep mean and personal passions far removed
from me in the coming years. The teaching of life has
of late done much to wean me from them, but the true
human requires culture and the false human suppression
every day of our lives and as long as we live."</p>

On primal rocks she wrote her name,<br />

The golden seed that bore her came<br />
Swift-winged with prayer o'er ocean waves.<br />
<br />
The Forest bowed his solemn crest,<br />

Till, fold by fold, the broidered Land<br />
To swell her virgin vestments grew,<br />
While Sages, strong in heart and hand,<br />
Her virtue's fiery girdle drew.<br />
<br />
O Exile of the wrath of Kings!<br />
O Pilgrim Ark of Liberty!<br />
The refuge of divinest things,<br />
Their record must abide in thee.<br />
<br />
First in the glories of thy front<br />
Let the crown jewel Truth be found;<br />
Thy right hand fling with generous wont<br />
Love's happy chain to farthest bound.<br />

Let Justice with the faultless scales<br />

<p><br />In January, 1867, a new note is sounded.</p>

<p>"In the evening attended meeting in behalf of Crete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
at which Chev presided and spoke. Excellent as to
matter, but always with a defective elocution, not
sending his voice out. He was much and deservedly
glorified by other speakers, and, indeed, his appearance
on this occasion was most touching and interesting.
Phillips was very fine; Huntington was careful, polished,
and interesting. Andrew read the resolutions,
with a splendid compliment to Chev."</p>

<p>Some months before this, in August, 1866, the Cretans
had risen against their Turkish oppressors, and
made a valiant struggle for freedom. From the first
the Doctor had been deeply interested in the insurrection:
now, as reports came of the sufferings of the brave
mountaineers, and of their women and children, who
had been sent to the mainland for safety, he felt impelled
to help them as he had helped their fathers forty
years before.</p>

<p>He was sixty-six years old, but looked much younger.
When, at the first meeting called by him, he rose and
said, "Forty-five years ago I was much interested in
the Greek Revolution," the audience was amazed. His
hair was but lightly touched with silver; his eyes were
as bright, his figure as erect and martial, as when, in
1826, he had fought and marched under the Greek
banner, and slept under the Greek stars, wrapped in his
shaggy capote.</p>

<p>His appeal in behalf of Crete roused the ever-generous
heart of Boston. Committees were formed, and
other meetings were held, among them that just described.
Governor Andrew's "splendid compliment"
to him was given thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>"I venture, Mr. Chairman, to make one single suggestion&mdash;that
if all of us were dumb to-night, if the
eloquent voices which have stimulated our blood and
inspired our hearts had been silent as the tomb, your
presence, sir, would have been more eloquent than a
thousand orations; when we remember that after the
life-time of a whole generation of men, he who forty
years ago bared his arm to seize the Suliote blade,
speaks again with the voice of his age in defence of the
cause of his youth."</p>

<p>Thirty-seven thousand dollars were raised for Crete,
and in March, 1867, Dr. Howe sailed again for Greece
on an errand of mercy. The Journal gives an outline
of the busy winter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The post is the poor man's valet...."</p>

<p>"<i>January 12.</i> A busy and studious day; had the
neighbors in after tea. Want clamors for relief, but
calls for cure, which begins in discipline...."</p>

<p>"<i>January 24.</i> N. P. Willis's funeral. Chev came
home quite suddenly and asked me to go with him to
the church, St. Paul's. The pallbearers were Longfellow
and Lowell, Drs. Holmes and Howe, Whipple
and Fields, T. B. Aldrich and I don't know who.
Coffin covered with flowers. Appearance of the family
interesting: the widow bowed and closely shrouded.
Thus ends a man of perhaps first-rate genius, ruined
by the adoption of an utterly frivolous standard of
labor and of life. George IV and Bulwer have to answer
for some of these failures.</p>

<p>"My tea party was delightful, friendly, not fashionable.
We had a good talk, and a lovely, familiar time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>"Heard J. F. C. Took my dear Francesco [Marion
Crawford] at his request, with great pleasure, feeling
that he would find there a living Jesus immortal in
influence, instead of the perfumed and embalmed
mummy of orthodoxy....</p>

<p>"Of that which is not clear one cannot have a clear
idea. My reading in Fichte to-day is of the most confused."</p>

<p>"<i>February 7.</i> Chev came dancing in to tell me that
Flossy is engaged to David Hall. His delight knew no
bounds. I am also pleased, for David is of excellent
character and excellent blood, the Halls being first-rate
people and with no family infirmity (insanity or
blindness). My only regret is that it must prove a long
engagement, David being a very young lawyer."</p>

<p>"<i>February 14.</i> All's up, as I feared, with 'Northern
Lights' in its present form. Gilmour proposes to go to
New York and to change its form and character to that
of a weekly newspaper. I of course retire from it and,
indeed, despite my title of editor, have been only
a reader of manuscripts and contributor&mdash;nothing
more. I have not had power of any sort to make
engagements."</p>

<p>The tenth number of "Northern Lights" was also the
last, and we hear no more of the ill-fated magazine.</p>

<p>The Journal says nothing of the proposed trip to
Greece, until February 15:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had rather die, it seems to me, than decide
wrongly about going to Europe and leaving the children.
And yet I am almost sure I shall do so. Chev
clearly wishes me to go.... Whether I go or stay, God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
help me to make the best of it. My desire to help Julia
is a strong point in favor of the journey. It would be,
I think, a turning-point for her."</p>

<p>Later she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Chev has taken our passage in the Asia, which sails
on the 13th proximo. So we have the note of preparation,
and the prospect of change and separation makes
us feel how happy we have been, in passing this whole
winter together."</p>

<p>The remaining days were full of work of every kind.
She gave readings here and there in aid of the Cretans.</p>

<p>"Ran about much: saw Miss Rogers's deaf pupils at
Mrs. Lamson's, very interesting.... For the first time
in three days got a peep at Fichte. Finished Jesse's
'George the Third.'</p>

<p>"Went to Roxbury to read at Mrs. Harrington's for
the benefit of the Cretans. It was a literary and musical
entertainment. Tickets, one dollar. We made one
hundred dollars. My poems were very kindly received.
Afterwards, in great haste, to Sophia Whitwell's,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
where I received a great ovation, all members greeting
me most affectionately. Presently Mr. [Josiah]
Quincy, with some very pleasant and complimentary
remarks on Dr. Howe and myself, introduced Mrs.
Silsbee's farewell verses to me, which were cordial and
feeling. Afterwards I read my valedictory verses,
strung together in a very headlong fashion, but just as
well liked as though I had bestowed more care upon
them. A bouquet of flowers crowned the whole, really
a very gratifying occasion."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>
<p>"<i>March 13.</i> Departure auspicious. Dear Maud,
Harry, and Flossy on board to say farewell, with J. S.
Dwight, H. P. Warner, and other near friends. Many
flowers; the best first day at sea I ever passed."</p>

<p>Julia and Laura were the happy two chosen to join
this expedition, the other children staying with relatives
and friends. From first to last the journey was
one of deepest interest. The Journal keeps a faithful
record of sight-seeing, which afterward took shape in
a volume, "From the Oak to the Olive," published in
1868, and dedicated "To S. G. H., the strenuous champion
of Greek liberty and of human rights."</p>

<p>It is written in the light vein of "A Trip to Cuba."
In the first chapter she says: "The less we know about
a thing, the easier it is to write about it. To give quite
an assured and fluent account of a country, we should
lose no time on our first arrival. The first impression
is the strongest. Familiarity constantly wears off the
edge of observation. The face of the new country
astonishes us once, and once only."</p>

<p>Though much that she saw during this trip was
already familiar to her, there is no lack of strength in
the impression. She sees things with new eyes; the
presence of "the neophytes," as she calls the daughters,
gives an atmosphere of "first sight" to the
whole.</p>

<p>In London she finds "the old delightful account
reopened, the friendly visits frequent, and the luxurious
invitations to dinner occupy every evening of our
short week."</p>

<p>"<i>London.</i> Lunch with the Benzons, whose palatial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
residence moved me not to envy. This seems an idle
word, but I like to record my satisfaction in a simple,
unencumbered life, without state of any kind, save my
pleasant relations and my good position in my own
country. Mrs. Benzon asked me to come alone to
dinner in the evening. First, however, I called upon
Arthur Mills at Hyde Park Gardens; then upon Mrs.
Ambassadress Adams, who was quite cordial; then in
frantic hurry home to dress. At Benzon's I met Robert
Browning, a dear and sacred personage, dear for his
own and his wife's sake. He sat next me at table and
by and by spoke very kindly of my foolish verses<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> about
himself and E. B. B. I mean he spoke of them with
magnanimity. Of course my <i>present</i> self would not
publish, nor I hope write, anything of the kind, but I
launched the arrow in the easy petulance of those days,
more occupied with its force and polish than with its
direction."</p>

<p>"To Lady Stanley's 5 o'clock tea, where I met her
daughter Lady Amberley and Sir Samuel Baker, the
explorer of the sources of the Nile. Dined with the
Benzons, meeting Browning again."</p>

<p>"Tea with Miss Cobbe. Met the Lyells. Dined with
Males family, Greek,&mdash;a most friendly occasion.
Afterwards went for a short time to Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, a very
wealthy Greek widow, who received us very ill. Heard
there Mr. Ap Thomas, a Welsh harper who plays exceedingly
well. The pleasure of hearing him scarcely
compensated for Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s want of politeness, which
was probably not intentional. Saw there Sir Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and Lady Baker, the latter wore an amber satin tunic
over a white dress, and a necklace of lion's teeth."</p>

<p>"<i>April 5.</i> Breakfast with Mr. Charles Dalrymple at
2 Clarges Street, where we met Mr. Grant Duff, Baron
McKaye, and others. Tea at Lady Trevelyan's, where
I was introduced to Dean Stanley of Westminster ...
and young Milman, son of the Reverend H. M. Lady
Stanley was Lady Augusta Bruce, a great favorite of
the Queen. Dined at Argyll Lodge, found the Duchess
serene and friendly; the Duke seemed hard and sensible,
Lord Lorne, the eldest son, very pleasant, and
Hon. Charles Howard and son most amiable, with more
breeding, I should say, than the Duke. Chev was the
hero of this occasion; the Duchess always liked him."</p>

<p>During this brief week, the Doctor had been in close
communication with the Greeks of London, who one
and all were eager to welcome him, and to bid him
Godspeed on his errand. His business transacted, he
felt that he must hurry on toward Greece. Some stay
must be made in Rome, where our Aunt Louisa (now
Mrs. Luther Terry) was anxiously expecting the party;
but even this tie of affection and friendship could not
keep the Doctor long from his quest. On May 1 he and
Julia went to Greece, the others remaining for some
weeks in Italy.</p>

<p>Sixteen years had passed since our mother's last
visit to Rome. She found some changes in the city,
but more vital ones in herself.</p>

<p>"I left Rome," she says, "after those days, with
entire determination, but with infinite reluctance.
America seemed the place of exile, Rome the home of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sympathy and comfort.... And now I must confess
that, after so many intense and vivid pages of life, this
visit to Rome, once a theme of fervent and solemn
desire, becomes a mere page of embellishment in a
serious and instructive volume."</p>

<p>Here follows a disquisition on "the Roman problem
for the American thinker"; the last passage gives her
conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A word to my countrymen and countrywomen,
who, lingering on the edge of the vase, are lured by its
sweets, and fall into its imprisonment. It is a false,
false superiority to which you are striving to join yourself.
A prince of puppets is not a prince, but a puppet;
a superfluous duke is no dux; a titular count does not
count. Dresses, jewels, and equipages of tasteless
extravagance; the sickly smile of disdain for simple
people; the clinging together, by turns eager and
haughty, of a clique that becomes daily smaller in
intention, and whose true decline consists in its numerical
increase&mdash;do not dream that these lift you in any
true way&mdash;in any true sense. For Italians to believe
that it does, is natural; for Englishmen to believe it, is
discreditable; for Americans, disgraceful."</p>

<p>The Terrys were at this time living in Palazzo
Odescalchi. Our mother observes that "the whole of
my modest house in Boylston Place would easily, as to
solid contents, lodge in the largest of those lofty rooms.
The Place itself would equally lodge in the palace. I
regard my re-found friends with wonder, and expect
to see them execute some large and stately man&oelig;uvre,
indicating their possession of all this space."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>It was Holy Week when they arrived in Rome, and
she was anxious that the "neophytes" should see as
much as possible of its impressive ceremonies. She
took them to St. Peter's to see the washing of the pilgrims'
feet by noble Roman ladies, and to hear the
"Miserere" in the Sistine Chapel. These functions are
briefly chronicled in the Journal and more fully in
"From the Oak to the Olive."</p>

<p>"Solid fact as the performance of the <i>functions</i> remains,
for us it assumes a forcible unreality, through
the impeding intervention of black dresses and veils,
with what should be women under them. But as these
creatures push like battering-rams, and caper like he-goats,
we shall prefer to adjourn the question of their
humanity, and to give it the benefit of a doubt. We
must except, however, our countrywomen from dear
Boston, who were not seen otherwise than decently and
in order."</p>

<p>A vivid description follows of the ceremonies of
Good Friday and Easter Sunday, ending with the
illumination of St. Peter's.</p>

<p>"A magical and unique spectacle it certainly is, with
the well-known change from the paper lanterns to the
flaring <i>lampions</i>. Costly is it of human labor, and
perilous to human life. And when I remembered that
those employed in it receive the sacrament beforehand,
in order that imminent death may not find them out of
a state of grace, I thought that its beauty did not so
much signify."</p>

<p>In the Journal she writes, April 19: "It is the golden
calf of old which has developed into the papal bull."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>At a concert she saw the Abbé Liszt, "whose vanity
and desire to attract attention were most apparent."</p>

<p>Though the sober light of middle age showed Rome
less magical than of old, yet the days were full of delight.</p>

<p>"In these scarce three weeks," she cries, "how much
have we seen, how little recorded and described! So
sweet has been the fable, that the intended moral has
passed like an act in a dream&mdash;a thing of illusion and
intention, not of fact. Impotent am I, indeed, to describe
the riches of this Roman world,&mdash;its treasures,
its pleasures, its flatteries, its lessons. Of so much that
one receives, one can give again but the smallest shred,&mdash;a
leaf of each flower, a scrap of each garment, a
proverb for a sermon, a stave for a song. So be it; so,
perhaps, it is best."</p>

<p>"Last Sunday I attended a Tombola at Piazza
Navona.... I know the Piazza of old. Sixteen years
since I made many a pilgrimage thither, in search of
Roman trash. I was not then past the poor amusement
of spending money for the sake of spending it. The
foolish things I brought home moved the laughter of
my little Roman public. I appeared in public with
some forlorn brooch or dilapidated earring; the giddy
laughed outright, and the polite gazed quietly. My
rooms were the refuge of all broken-down vases and
halting candelabra. I lived on the third floor of a modest
lodging, and all the wrecks of art that neither first,
second, nor fourth would buy, found their way into
my parlor, and stayed there at my expense. I recall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
some of these adornments to-day. Two heroes, in
painted wood, stood in my dark little entry. A gouty
Cupid in bas-relief encumbered my mantelpiece. Two
forlorn figures in black and white glass recalled the
auction whose unlucky prize they had been. And
Horace Wallace, coming to talk of art and poetry, on
my red sofa, sometimes saluted me with a paroxysm
of merriment, provoked by the sight of my last purchase.
Those days are not now. Of their accumulations
I retain but a fragment or two. Of their delights remain
a tender memory, a childish wonder at my own childishness.
To-day, in heathen Rome, I can find better
amusement than those shards and rags were ever able
to represent."</p>

<p>On May 26 she writes in her Journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I remembered the confusion of my mind when I
was here sixteen years ago and recognized how far
more than equivalent for the vivacity of youth, now
gone, is the gain of a steadfast standard of good and
happiness. To desire supremely ends which are incompatible
with no one's happiness and which promote the
good of all&mdash;this even as an ideal is a great gain from
the small and eager covetousness of personal desires.
Religion gives this steadfast standard whose pursuit is
happiness. Therefore let him who seeks religion be
glad that he seeks the only true good of which, indeed,
we constantly fail, and yet in seeking it are constantly
renewed.... Studios of Mozier and of Rogers&mdash;the
former quite full. Both have considerable skill, neither
has genius. The statues of Miss Hosmer are marble
silences&mdash;they have nothing to say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>Greece was before her. On June 17 the Journal
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Acroceraunian mountains, shore of Albania. Nothing
strikes me&mdash;I have been struck till I am stricken
down. <i>Sirocco</i> and head wind&mdash;vessel laboring with
the sea, I with Guizot's 'Meditations,' which also have
some head wind in them. They seem to me inconclusive
in statement and commonplace in thought, yet
presenting some facts of interest. A little before 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
we passed Fano, the island on which Calypso could not
console herself, and no wonder. At 2 we enter the
channel of Corfù."</p>

<p>At Corfù a Turkish pacha came on board with his
harem, to our lively interest. The Journal gives every
observable detail of the somewhat squalid <i>ménage</i>,
from the pacha's lilac trousers down to the dress of
his son and heir, a singularly dirty baby. She remarks
that "An Irish servant's child in Boston, got up for
Sunday, looks far cleaner and better."</p>

<p>The pacha looked indolent and good-natured, and
sent coffee to her before she disembarked at Syra. Here
she was met by Mr. Evangelides, the "Christy" of her
childhood, the Greek boy befriended by her father.
He was now a prosperous man in middle life, full of
affectionate remembrance of the family at 16 Bond
Street, and of gratitude to "dear Mr. Ward." He welcomed
her most cordially, and introduced her not only
to the beauties of Syra, but to its principal inhabitants,
the governor of the Cyclades, the archbishop, and Doctor
Hahn, the scientist and antiquary. She conversed
with the archbishop in German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>"He deplored the absence of a state religion in
America. I told him that the progress of religion in
our country seemed to establish the fact that society
attains the best religious culture through the greatest
religious liberty. He replied that the members should
all be united under one head. 'Yes,' said I, 'but the
Head is invisible'; and he repeated after me, 'Indeed,
the Head is invisible.' I will here remark that nothing
could have been more refreshing to the New England
mind than this immediate introduction to the theological
opinions of the East."</p>

<p>A few hours later his Grace returned the visit, seeking
in his turn, it would appear, the refreshment of a
new point of view.</p>

<p>"We resumed our conversation of the morning, and
the celibacy of the clerical hierarchy came next in order
in our discussion. The father was in something of a
strait between the Christian dignification of marriage
and its ascetic depreciation. The arrival of other
visitors forced us to part, with this interesting point
still unsettled."</p>

<p>Arrived in Athens, the travellers found the "veteran"
(as the Doctor is called throughout her book) in
full tide of work. The apartment in the pleasant hotel
swarmed with dark-eyed patriots, with Cretan refugees,
with old men who had known "Xaos" in the
brave days of old, with young men eager to see and
greet the old Philhellene. Among the latter came
Michael Anagnostopoulos, who was to become his
secretary, and later his son-in-law and his successor
at the Perkins Institution for the Blind. The ladies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Athens came too, full of hospitable feeling. There were
visits, deputations, committee meetings, all day long,
and in the evening parties and receptions.</p>

<p>Spite of all this, her first impression of Athens was
melancholy. She was oppressed and depressed at sight
of the havoc wrought by Time and war upon monuments
that should have been sacred. Speaking of the
Parthenon, she exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And Pericles caused it to be built; and this, his
marble utterance, is now a lame sentence, with half
its sense left out....</p>

<p>"Here is the Temple of Victory. Within are the bas-reliefs
of the Victories arriving in the hurry of their
glorious errands. Something so they tumbled in upon
us when Sherman conquered the Carolinas, and Sheridan
the Valley of the Shenandoah, when Lee surrendered,
and the glad President went to Richmond. One
of these Victories is untying her sandal, in token of
permanent abiding. Yet all of them have trooped away
long since, scared by the hideous havoc of barbarians.
And the bas-reliefs, their marble shadows, have all
been battered and mutilated into the saddest mockery
of their original tradition. The statue of Wingless
Victory, that stood in the little temple, has long been
absent and unaccounted for. But the only Victory
that the Parthenon now can seize or desire is this very
Wingless Victory, the triumph of a power that retreats
not&mdash;the power of Truth.</p>

<p>"I give heed to all that is told me in a dreary and
desolate manner. It is true, no doubt,&mdash;this was, and
this, and this; but what I see is, none the less, emptiness,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
broken eggshell of a civilization which
Time has hatched and devoured. And this incapacity
to reconstruct the past goes with me through most of
my days in Athens. The city is so modern, and its
circle so small! The trumpeters who shriek around the
Theseum in the morning, the café-keeper who taxes
you for a chair beneath the shadow of the Olympian
columns, the <i>custode</i> who hangs about to see that you
do not break the broken marbles further, or carry off
their piteous fragments, all of these are significant of
modern Greece; but the ruins have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>"Poor as these relics are, in comparison with what
one would wish them to be, they are still priceless. This
Greek marble is the noblest in descent; it needs no
eulogy. These forms have given the models for a hundred
familiar and commonplace works, which caught a
little gleam of their glory, squaring to shapeliness some
town-house of the West, or Southern bank or church.
So well do we know them in the prose of modern design
that we are startled at seeing them transfigured in the
poetry of their own conception. Poor old age! poor old
columns!"</p>

<p>There was a colony of Cretan refugees at Nauplia,
another at Argos, both in dire need of food and clothing.
The Doctor asked the Government for a steamer,
and received the Parados, in which he promptly embarked
with wife, daughters, and supplies, and sailed
for Nauplia.</p>

<p>The travelling library of this expedition was reduced
to "a copy of Machiavelli's '<i>Principe</i>,' a volume of
Muir's 'Greece,' and a Greek phrase-book on Ollendorff's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
principle." Our mother also took some worsted
work, but she suffered such lively torment from the
bites of mosquitoes and sand-fleas on her hands and
wrists that she could make little use of this. To one
recalling the anguish of this visitation, it seems amazing
that she could even write in her Journal; indeed,
the entries, though tolerably regular, are brief and
condensed.</p>

<p>"<i>June 24....</i> We arrived in the harbor of Nauplia
by 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> ... Crowd in the street. Bandit's head just
cut off and brought in. We go to the prefect's house, ...
he offers us his roof&mdash;sends out for mattresses....
I mad with my mosquito bites. Mattresses on the
floor. We women lie down four in a row, very thankfully...."</p>

<p>At the fortress of Nauplia, she was deeply touched
by the sight of a band of prisoners waiting, in an
inner court, for the death to which they had been
condemned.</p>

<p>"'Do not pity them, madam!' said the major; 'they
have all done deeds worthy of death.'</p>

<p>"But how not to pity them," she cries, "when they
and we are made of the same fragile human stuff, that
corrupts so easily to crime, and is always redeemable,
if society would only afford the costly process of redemption!</p>

<p>"As I looked at them, I was struck by a feeling of
their helplessness. What is there in the world so helpless
as a disarmed criminal? No inner armor has he to
beat back the rude visiting of society; no secure soul-citadel,
where scorn and anger cannot reach him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
has thrown away the jewel of his manhood; human law
crushes its empty case. But the final Possessor and
Creditor is unseen."</p>

<p>After Nauplia came Argos, where the Cretan refugees
were gathered in force. Here the travellers had
the great pleasure of helping to clothe the half-naked
women and children. Many of the garments had been
made by Florence and her young friends in their sewing
circle; the book recalls "how the little maidens took off
their feathery bonnets and dainty gloves, wielding the
heavy implements of cutting, and eagerly adjusting the
arms and legs, the gores and gathers! With patient
pride the mother trotted off to the bakery, that a few
buns might sustain these strenuous little cutters and
sewers, whose tongues, however active over the charitable
work, talked, we may be sure, no empty nonsense
nor unkind gossip. For charity begins indeed at home,
in the heart, and, descending to the fingers, rules also
the rebellious member whose mischief is often done
before it is meditated. At sight of these well-made
garments a little swelling of the heart seized us, with
the love and pride of remembrance so dear."</p>

<p>The Journal describes briefly the distribution among
the Cretans, "some extremely bare and ragged, with
suffering little children. Our calico skirts and sacks
made a creditable appearance. We gave with as much
judgment as the short time permitted. Each name was
called by a list, and as they came in we hastily selected
garments: the dresses, however, gave out before we
had quite finished.... Ungrateful old woman, who
wanted a gown and would hardly take a chemise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Meddlesome lady of the neighborhood bringing in her
favorites out of order."</p>

<p>Generous as the supplies from America were, they
did not begin to meet the demand. After visiting Crete
(in spite&mdash;perhaps partly because&mdash;of the fact that
a high price was set on his head) and the various colonies
of refugees, the Doctor felt that further aid
must be obtained. Accordingly, the journeyings of
the little party after leaving Greece were for the most
part only less hurried than the earlier ones, the exception
being a week of enchantment spent in Venice,
awaiting the Doctor, who had been called back to
Athens at the moment of departure.</p>

<p>The Journal tells of Verona, Innsbrück, Munich.
Then came flying glimpses of Switzerland, with a few
days' rest at Geneva, where she had the happiness of
meeting her sister once more; finally, Paris and the
Exposition of 1867.</p>

<p>After a visit to Napoleon's tomb, she writes: "Spent
much of the afternoon in beginning a piece of tapestry
after a Pompeiian pattern copied by me on the spot."</p>

<p>Worsted work was an unfailing accompaniment of
her journeyings in those days; indeed, until age and
weariness came upon her, she never failed to have some
piece of work on hand. When her eyes could no longer
compass cross-stitch embroidery, she amused herself
with knitting, or with "hooking" small rugs.</p>

<p>Her sketchbook was another resource while travelling.
She had no special talent for drawing, but took
great pleasure in it, and was constantly making pencil
sketches of persons and things that interested her. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
even find patterns of Pompeiian mosaic or of historic
needlework reproduced in the Journal.</p>

<p>From Paris the travellers hurried to Belgium, and
after a glance at Brussels, spent several days in Antwerp
with great contentment. Both here and in Brussels
she had been much interested in the beautiful lace
displayed on every hand. She made several modest
purchases, not without visitings of conscience.</p>

<p>"I went to the Cathedral.... I saw to-day the
Elevation of the Cross [Rubens] to special advantage.
As I stood before it, I felt lifted for a moment
above the mean and foolish pleasures of shopping, etc.,
on which I have of late dwelt so largely. The heroic
face before me said, 'You cannot have those and these,
cannot have Christian elevation with heathen triviality.'
That moment showed me what a picture can do.
I hope I shall remember it, though I do plead guilty of
late to an extraordinary desire for finery of all sorts.
It is as if I were going home to play the part of Princess
in some great drama, which is not at all likely to
be the case."</p>

<p>Yet the same day she went to the beguinage and
bought "Flossy's wedding hdkf, 22 frc&mdash;lace scarf,
3 fr., piece of edging, 4 fr."</p>

<p>Among the notabilities of Antwerp in those days was
Charles Félu, the armless painter. He was to be seen
every day in the Museum, copying the great masters
with skill and fidelity. He interested the Doctor
greatly, and the whole party made acquaintance with
him. A letter from one of them describes the meeting
with this singular man:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>"As we were looking round at the pictures, I noticed
a curious painting arrangement. There was a platform
raised about a foot above the floor, with two stools,
one in front of the other, and an easel. Presently the
artist entered. The first thing he did, on stepping on
the platform, was to kick off his shoes. He then seated
himself (Heaven knows how) on one stool and placed
his feet in front of him on the other, close before the
easel. I was surprised to see that his stockings had no
toes to them. But my surprise was much greater when
I saw him take the palette in one foot and the brush in
the other, and begin to paint. The nicety with which
he picked out his brushes, rubbed the paints, erased
with his great toe, etc., was a mystery to me.... In a
few minutes he put his foot into his pocket, drew out a
paper from which he took his card, and <i>footed</i> it politely
to papa.... He shaves himself, plays billiards (and
well, too), cards, and dominoes, cuts up his meat and
feeds himself, etc."</p>

<p>"<i>October 1.</i> By accident went to the same hotel [in
Bruges] to which I went twenty-four years ago, a bride.
I recognized a staircase with a balustrade of swans
each holding a stiff bulrush in its mouth.... Made a
little verse thereupon."</p>

<p>From Belgium the way led to London; thence, after
a brief and delightful visit to the Bracebridges at
Atherstone, to Liverpool, where the China awaited her
passengers. The voyage was long and stormy, thirteen
days: the Journal speaks chiefly of its discomforts; but
on the second Sunday we read: "X. preached a horrible
sermon&mdash;stood up and mocked at philosophy in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
English and bad Christianity. He failed alike of satire
and of sense, and talked like a small Pharisee of two
thousand years ago. 'Not much like the Sermon on
the Mount,' quoth I; not theology enough to stand
examination at Andover. Bluejackets in a row, unedified,
as were most of us."</p>

<p>On October 25 the travellers landed in Boston,
thankful to be again on firm land, and to see the family
unit once more complete.</p>

<p>"The dear children came on board to greet us&mdash;all
well, and very happy at our return."</p>

<p>Thus ends the story, seven months of wonder and
of delight.</p>

<p>At her Club, soon after, she gave the following epitome
of the trip, singing the doggerel lines to an improvised
tune which matched them in absurdity:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Oh! who were the people you saw, Mrs. Howe,<br />

When you went where the Cretans were making a row?<br />
Emancipation&mdash;civilization&mdash;redintegration of a great nation,<br />

<h4>1867-1871; <i>aet.</i> 48-52</h4>

<p>
"Behold," he said, "Life's great impersonate,<br />

</p>


<p><br />After such a rush of impression and emotion, the
return to everyday life could not fail to bring about a
corresponding drop in our mother's mental barometer.
Vexations awaited her. The Boylston Place house had
been let for a year, and&mdash;Green Peace being also let
on a long lease&mdash;the reunited family took refuge for
the winter in the "Doctor's Wing" of the Perkins
Institution.</p>

<p>Again, an extremely unfavorable critique of "Later
Lyrics" in a prominent review distressed her greatly;
her health was more or less disturbed; above all, the
sudden death of John A. Andrew, the beloved and
honored friend of many years, saddened both her and
the Doctor deeply.</p>

<p>All these things affected her spirits to some extent,
so that the Journal for the remainder of 1867 is in a
minor key.</p>

<p>"... In despair about the house...."</p>

<p>On hearing of the separation of Charles Sumner from
his wife:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For men and women to come together is nature&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
them to live together is art&mdash;to live well, high
art."</p>

<p>"<i>November 21.</i> Melancholy, thinking that I did but
poorly last evening [at a reading from her 'Notes on
Travel' at the Church of the Disciples].... At the
afternoon concert felt a savage and tearful melancholy,
a profound friendlessness. In the whole large assembly
I saw no one who would help me to do anything
worthy of my powers and life-ideal. I have so dreamed
of high use that I cannot decline to a life of amusement
or of small occupation."</p>

<p>"... I believe in God, but am utterly weary of man."</p>

<p>After a disappointment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... To church, where my mental condition speedily
improved. Sermon on the Good Samaritan. Hymns
and prayers all congenial and consoling. Felt much
consoled and uplifted out of all petty discords and disappointments.
A disappointment should be digested
in patience, not vomited in spleen. Bitter morsels
nourish the soul, not less perhaps than sweet. Thought
of the following: Moral philosophy begins with the
fact of accepting human life."</p>

<p>In November came a new interest which was to
mean much to her.</p>

<p>"Early in town to attend the Free Religious Club.
Weiss's essay was well written, but encumbered with
illustrations rarely pertinent. It was neither religion,
philosophy, nor cosmology, but a confusion of all three,
showing the encyclopædic aim of his culture. It advocated
the natural to the exclusion of the supernatural.
Being invited to speak, I suggested real and ideal as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
better antithesis for thought than natural and supernatural.
Weiss did all that his method would allow.
He is a man of parts. I cannot determine how much,
but the Parkerian standard, or a similar one, has
deformed his reasoning powers. He seeks something
better than Christianity without having half penetrated
the inner significance of that religion.</p>

<p>"Alcott spoke in the idealistic direction. Also
Wasson very well. Lucretia Mott exceptionally well,
a little rambling, but with true womanly intuitions of
taste and of morality."</p>

<p>This association of thinkers was afterwards known
as the "Boston Radical Club." She has much to say
about it in her "Reminiscences."</p>

<p>"I did, indeed," she says, "hear at these meetings
much that pained and even irritated me. The disposition
to seek outside the limits of Christianity for all
that is noble and inspiring in religious culture, and to
recognize especially within these limits the superstition
and intolerance which have been the bane of all religions&mdash;this
disposition, which was frequently manifested
both in the essays presented and in their discussion,
offended not only my affections, but also my sense
of justice....</p>

<p>"Setting this one point aside, I can but speak of the
Club as a high congress of souls, in which many noble
thoughts were uttered. Nobler than any special view
or presentation was the general sense of the dignity of
human character and of its affinity with things divine,
which always gave the master tone to the discussions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>She says elsewhere of the Radical Club:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The really radical feature in it was the fact that the
thoughts presented at its meetings had a root; were
in that sense radical.... Here I have heard Wendell
Phillips, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, John Weiss and
James Freeman Clarke, Athanase Coquerel, the noble
French Protestant preacher; William Henry Channing,
worthy nephew of his great uncle; Colonel Higginson,
Doctor Bartol, and many others. Extravagant things
were sometimes said, no doubt, and the equilibrium of
ordinary persuasion was not infrequently disturbed for
a time. But the satisfaction of those present when a
sound basis of thought was vindicated and established
is indeed pleasant in remembrance...."</p>

<p>"To Dickens's second reading, which I enjoyed very
much. The 'wreck' in 'David Copperfield' was finely
given. His appearance is against success; the face
is rather commonplace, seen at a distance, and very
red if seen through a glass: the voice worn and
<i>blasé</i>."</p>

<p>"... Club in the evening, at which my nonsense
made people laugh, as I wished...."</p>

<p>"A little intoxicated with the pleasure of having
made people laugh. A fool, however, can often do this
better than a wise man. I look earnestly for a higher
task. Yet innocent, intelligent laughter is not to be
despised."</p>

<p>"Was taken with verses in church. They did not
prove nearly as good as I had hoped...."</p>

<p>"Made three beds, to help Bridget, who had the
washing alone. Read a difficult chapter in Fichte."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>"Studied and worried as usual,&mdash;Fichte and
Greek...."</p>

<p>"Have not been strenuous enough about the Cretan
Fair...."</p>

<p>Any lack of strenuousness about the Cretan Fair
was amply atoned for.</p>

<p>An "Appeal" was published, written by her and
signed by Julia Ward Howe, Emily Talbot, Sarah E.
Lawrence, Caroline A. Mudge, and Abby W. May.</p>

<p>"What shall we say? They are a great way off, but
they are starving and perishing, as none in our midst
can starve and perish, and we Americans are among
the few persons to whom they can look for help."</p>

<p>In this cry for aid we hear the voice of both parents.
The response was cordial and generous. The fair was
held in Easter Week, at the Boston Music Hall, and
recalled on a smaller scale the glories of the war-time
fairs. Of the great labor of preparation, the Journal
gives a lively impression; and "speaking for Crete"
was added to the other burdens borne by her and the
Doctor.</p>

<p>She could not give up her studies; the entries for
the winter of 1867-68 are a curious mingling of Fichte
and committees, with here and there a prayer for
spiritual help and guidance, which shows her overwrought
condition.</p>

<p>Another interest had come to her from the visit to
Greece: the study of ancient Greek. Latin had been
her lifelong friend, but she had always longed for the
sister classic; now the time was ripe for it. She made
a beginning in Athens, not only picking up a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of modern Greek, but attacking the ancient language
with the aid of primer and phrase-book. A valuable
teacher was at hand in Michael Anagnos,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> who
was aiding the Doctor as secretary, and preparing
himself for the principal work of his life. Anagnos
encouraged and assisted her in the new study, which
became one of her greatest delights. She looked forward
to a Greek lesson as girls do to a ball; in later life
she was wont to say, "My Greek is my diamond necklace!"</p>


<p><br />"<i>January 1, 1868.</i> May I this year have energy,
patience, good-will and good faith. May I be guilty
of no treason against duty and my best self. May I
acquire more system, order, and wisdom in the use
of things. May I, if God wills, carry out some of my
plans for making my studies useful to others. This is
much to ask, but not too much of Him who giveth
all."</p>

<p>"<i>January 24.</i> A dreadfully busy day. Meeting of
General Committee on Cretan Fair.... Felt overcome

<p>"<i>January 26.</i> Some mental troubles have ended
in a determination to hold fast till death the liberty
wherewith Christ has made me free. The joyous belief
that his doctrine of influences can keep me from all
that I should most greatly dread, lifts me up like a pair
of strong wings. 'I shall run and not be weary. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
walk and not faint.' At church the first hymn contained
this line:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'Her fathers' God before her moved'&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>which quite impressed me, for my father's piety and
the excellence of other departed relatives have always
of late years been a support and pledge to me of my
own good behavior."</p>

<p>"The thief's heart, the wanton's brow, may accompany
high talent and geniality of temperament; but
thanks be to God they <i>need</i> not."</p>

<p>"... Wished I could make a fine poetic picture of
Paul preaching at Mars Hill. On the one side, the glittering
statues and brilliant mythology&mdash;on the other,
the simplicity of the Christian life and doctrine. But
to-day no pictures came."</p>

<p>"Much business&mdash;no Greek lesson. I was feeble in
mind and body, and brooded over the loss of the lesson
in a silly manner. Habit is to me not second, but first
nature, and I easily become mechanical and fixed in my
routine.... I confess that to lay down Greek now
would be to die, like Moses, in sight of the promised
land. All my life I have longed for this language...."</p>

Anagnos and took him with me. My dæmon [Socratic]

and read it. I find my dæmon justified. It seemed to
have a certain fitness in calling forth discussion. Mr.
Emerson first spoke very beautifully, then Mr. Alcott,
these two sympathizing in my view. Wasson followed,
a little off, but with a very friendly contrast.... Much
of this talk was very interesting. It was all marked by
power and sincerity, but Emerson and Alcott understood
my essay better than the others except J. F. C.
I introduced Anagnos to Emerson. I told him that he
had seen the Olympus of New England. Thought of
my dear lost son, dead in this house [13 Chestnut

<p>On April 13 the fair opened; a breathless week followed.

<p>"Greek lesson&mdash;rehearsal in the evening&mdash;choral
symphony and <i>Lobgesang</i>."</p>

<p>During the summer of 1868 she had great pleasure in
reading some of her essays at Newport, in the Unitarian
Church. She notes in her "Reminiscences" that one
lady kissed her after the reading, saying, "This is the
way I want to hear women speak"; and that Mrs.
P&mdash;&mdash; S&mdash;&mdash;, on hearing the words, "If God works,
madam, you can afford to work also!" rose and went
out, saying, "I won't listen to such stuff as this!"</p>

<p>The parlor readings brought her name into wider
prominence. She began to receive invitations to read
and speak in public.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson wrote to her concerning her philosophical
readings: "The scheme is excellent&mdash;to read
thus&mdash;so new and rare, yet so grateful to all parties.
It costs genius to invent our simplest pleasures."</p>

<p>The winter of 1867-68 saw the birth of another institution
which was to be of lifelong interest to her: the
New England Woman's Club. This, one of the earliest
of women's clubs, was organized on February 16,
1868, with Mrs. Caroline M. Severance, in whose
mind the idea had first taken shape, as president.
Its constitution announces the objects of the association
as "primarily, to furnish a quiet, central resting-place,
and place of meeting in Boston, for the comfort
and convenience of its members: and ultimately
to become an organized social centre for united thought
and action."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>How far the second clause has outdone and outshone
the first, is known to all who know anything of the
history of women's clubs. From the New England
Woman's Club and its cousin Sorosis, founded a
month later in New York, has grown the great network
of clubs which, like a beneficent railway system
of thought and good-will, penetrates every nook and
corner of this country.</p>

<p>Our mother was one of the first vice-presidents of the
Club, and from 1871 to her death in 1910, with two
brief intervals, its president. Among all the many
associations with which she was connected this was
perhaps the nearest to her heart. "My dear Club!" no
other organization brought such a tender ring to her
voice. She never willingly missed a meeting; the
monthly teas were among her great delights. The
Journal has much to say about the Club: "a good
meeting"; "a thoughtful, earnest meeting," are frequent
entries. "Why!" she cried once, "we may be
living in the Millennium without knowing it!"</p>

<p>In her "Reminiscences," after telling how she attended
the initial meeting, and "gave a languid assent
to the measure proposed," she adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Out of this small beginning was gradually developed
the plan of the New England Woman's Club, a
strong and stately association, destined, I believe, to
last for many years, and having behind it, at this time
of my writing, a record of three decades of happy and
acceptable service."</p>

<p>The Club movement was henceforth to be one of her
widest interests. To thousands of elder women in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
late sixties and early seventies it came like a new
gospel of activity and service. They had reared their
children and seen them take flight; moreover, they had
fought through the war, their hearts in the field, their
fingers plying needle and thread. They had been active
in committees and commissions the country over; had
learned to work with and beside men, finding joy and
companionship and inspiration in such work. How
could they go back to the chimney-corner life of the
fifties? In answer to their question&mdash;an answer from
Heaven, it seemed&mdash;came the women's clubs, with
their opportunities for self-culture and for public
service.</p>

<p>At first Society looked askance at the movement.
What? Women's clubs? They would take women away
from the Home, which was their Sphere! Shocking!
Besides, it might make them Strong-Minded! Horrible!
("But," said J. W. H., "I would rather be strong-minded
than weak-minded!")</p>

<p>Possibly influenced in some measure by such plaints
as these, the early clubs devoted themselves for the
most part to study, and their range of activities was
strictly limited and defined. This, however, could not
last. The Doctor used to say, "You may as well refuse
to let out the growing boy's trousers as refuse larger
and larger liberty to his growing individuality!"
Even so the club petticoats had to be lengthened and
amplified.</p>

<p>Our mother, with all her love of study, realized that
no individual or group of individuals must neglect the
present with its living issues for any past, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
beautiful. She threw her energies into widening the
club horizon. "Don't tie too many <i>nots</i> in your constitution!"
she would say to a young club; and then
she would tell how Florence Nightingale cut the
Gordian knots of red tape in the Crimea.</p>

<p>Did the constitution enforce such and such limits?
Ah! but committees were not thus limited; let a committee
be appointed, to do what the club could not!
(This was what the Doctor called "whipping the devil
round the stump!")</p>

<p>Many and many a reform had its beginning in one
of those quiet Park Street rooms of the "N. E. W. C."
"When I want anything in Boston remedied," said
Edward Everett Hale, "I go down to the New England
Woman's Club!"</p>

<p>When the General Federation of Women's Clubs
was formed in 1892, our mother served on the board
of directors for four years, and was then made an
honorary vice-president. She was also president of
the Massachusetts State Federation from 1893 to
1898, and thereafter honorary president.</p>

<p>Dr. Holmes once said to her, "Mrs. Howe, I consider
you eminently clubable"; and he added that he himself
was not. He told us why, when he adopted the
title of "Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table." The most
brilliant of talkers, he did not care to listen, as a good
club member must. Now, she too loved talking, but
perhaps she loved listening even more. No one who
knew her in her later years can forget how intently she
listened, how joyously she received information of
any and every kind. She never was tired; she always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
wanted more. All human experience thrilled her; the
choreman, the dressmaker, the postman, the caller;
one and all, she hung on their words. After a half-hour
with her, seeing her face alight with sympathy,
her delicate lips often actually forming the words as
he spoke them, the dullest person might go away on
air, feeling himself a born <i>raconteur</i>. What she said
once of Mr. Emerson, "He always came into a room
as if he expected to receive more than he gave!" was
true of herself.</p>

<p>To return to the clubs! At a biennial meeting of
the General Federation in Philadelphia, she said:
"What did the club life give me? Understanding of
my own sex; faith in its moral and intellectual growth.
Like so many others, I saw the cruel wrongs and vexed
problems of our social life, but I did not know that hidden
away in its own midst was a reserve force destined
to give precious aid in the righting of wrongs, and in
the solution of discords. In the women's clubs I found
the immense power which sympathy exercises in bringing
out the best aspirations of the woman nature....
To guard against dangers, we must do our utmost to
uphold and keep in view the high object which has, in
the first instance, called us together; and let this be
no mere party catchword or cry, as East against West,
or North against South. We can afford to meet as
citizens of one common country, and to love and serve
the whole as one."</p>

<p>She believed firmly in maintaining the privacy of
club life. "The club is a larger home," she said, "and
we wish to have the immunities and defences of home;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
therefore we do not wish the public present, even by
its attorney, the reporter."</p>

<p>The three following years were important ones to
the Howe family.</p>

<p>Lawton's Valley was sold, to our great and lasting
grief: and&mdash;after a summer spent at Stevens Cottage
near Newport&mdash;the Doctor bought the place now
known as "Oak Glen," scarce half a mile from the Valley;
a place to become only less dear to the family.
No. 19 Boylston Place was also sold, and he bought
No. 32 Mount Vernon Street, a sunny, pleasant house
whose spacious rooms and tall windows recalled the
Chestnut Street house, always regretted.</p>

<p>Here life circled ever faster and faster, fuller and
fuller. Our father, though beginning to feel the weight
of years, had not yet begun to "take in sail," but continued
to pile labor on labor, adding the new while
never abandoning the old. For our mother clubs, societies,
studies were multiplying, while for both family
cares and interests were becoming more and more
complicated. The children were now mostly grown.
To the mother's constant thought and anxiety about
their teeth, their hair, their eyes, their music, their
dancing&mdash;to say nothing of the weightier matters of
the law&mdash;was added the consideration of their ball
dresses, their party slippers, their partners. She went
with the daughters to ball and assembly; if they
danced, she was happy; if not, there was grief behind
the cheerful smile, and a sigh was confided to the
Journal next day.</p>

<p>Romance hovered over No. 32 Mount Vernon Street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
The Greek lessons which were to mean so much to
Julia and Laura were brought to a sudden end by the
engagement of Julia to the Greek teacher, Michael
Anagnos. Florence (who was now housekeeper, lightening
our mother's cares greatly) was already engaged
to David Prescott Hall; while Laura's engagement to
Henry Richards was announced shortly after Julia's.</p>

<p>The three marriages followed at intervals of a few
months. Meantime Harry, whose youthful pranks had
been the terror of both parents, had graduated from
Harvard, and was now, after two years<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, beginning his chosen
work as a metallurgist.</p>

<p>She wrote of this beloved son:&mdash;</p>

<p>
God gave my son a palace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a kingdom to control;</span><br />
The palace of his body,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The kingdom of his soul.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In childhood and boyhood this "palace" was inhabited
by a tricksy sprite. At two years Harry was
pulling the tails of the little dogs on the Roman Pincio;
at eighteen he was filling the breasts of the college
authorities with the same emotions inspired by his
father in the previous generation.</p>

<p>"Howe," said the old President of Brown University,
when the Chevalier called to pay his respects
on his return from Greece, "I am afraid of you now!
There may be a fire-cracker under my chair at this
moment!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>Once out of college, it fared with the son as with the
father. The current of restless energy hitherto devoted
to "monkey shines" (as the Doctor called them) was
now turned into another channel. Work, hardly less
arduous and unremitting than his father's, became the
habit of his life. Science claimed him, and her he
served with the same singleness of purpose, the same
intensity of devotion with which his parents served
the causes that claimed them. He married, in 1874,
Fannie, daughter of Willard Gay, of Troy, New York.</p>

<p>We love to recall the time at this house on Beacon
Hill. We remember it as a cheerful house, ringing with
song and laughter, yet with a steady undercurrent of
work and thought; the "precious time," not to be
interrupted; the coming and going of grave men and
earnest women, all bent on high and hopeful errands,
all seeking our two Wise Ones for counsel, aid, sympathy;
the coming and going also of a steady stream
of "lame ducks" of both sexes and all nationalities, all
requiring help, most of them getting it; yet, as ever,
the father leaving State Charities and Reforms, the
mother flying from Fichte or Xenophon, at any real
or fancied need of any child. It is thus that we love
to think of No. 32 Mount Vernon Street, the last of
the many homes in which we were all together.</p>

<p><br />When a branch is cut from a vigorous tree, Nature
at once sets to work to adjust matters. New juices
flow, new tissues form, the wound is scarfed over, and
after a time is seen only as a scar. Not here, but elsewhere,
does the new growth take place, the fresh green
shoots appear, more vigorous for the pruning.</p>

<p>Thus it was with our mother's life, as one change
after another came across it. Little Sam died, and
her heart withered with him: then religion and study
came to her aid, and through them she reached another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
blossoming time of thought and accomplishment
Now, with the marriage and departure of the children,
still another notable change was wrought, rather
joyful than sorrowful, but none the less marking an
epoch.</p>

<p>Up to this time (1871) the wide, sunny rooms of
the house on Beacon Hill had been filled with young,
active life. The five children, their friends, their music,
their parties, their talk and laughter, kept youth
and gayety at full tide: the green branches grew and
blossomed.</p>

<p>For all five she had been from their cradle not only
mistress of the revels and chief musician, but spur and
beacon of mind and soul.</p>

<p>Now four of the five were transplanted to other
ground. Many women, confronting changes like these,
say to themselves, "It is over. For me there is no more
active life; instead, the shelf and the chimney corner."
This woman, lifting her eyes from the empty spaces,
saw Opportunity beckoning from new heights, and
moved gladly to meet her. Now, as ever, she "staked
her life upon the red."</p>

<p>The empty spaces must be filled. Study no longer
sufficed: the need of serving humanity actively, hand
and foot, pen and voice, was now urgent.</p>

<p>Her first work under this new impulse was for peace.
The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 made a deep and
painful impression upon her. She had felt a bitter dislike
for Louis Napoleon ever since the day when he
"stabbed France in her sleep" by the <i>Coup d'État</i> of
December, 1851; but she loved France and the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
people; the overwhelming defeat, the bitter humiliation
suffered by them filled her with sorrow and indignation.
In a lecture on Paris she says: "The great
Exposition of 1867 had drawn together an immense
crowd from all parts of the world. Among its marvels,
my recollection dwells most upon the gallery of French
paintings, in which I stood more than once before a
full-length portrait of the then Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> I looked into
the face which seemed to say: 'I have succeeded.
What has any one to say about it?' And I pondered
the slow movements of that heavenly Justice whose
infallible decrees are not to be evaded."</p>

<p>Her "Reminiscences" say: "As I was revolving
these matters in my mind, while the war was still in
progress, I was visited by a sudden feeling of the cruel
and unnecessary character of the contest. It seemed to
me a return to barbarism, the issue having been one
which might easily have been settled without bloodshed.
The question forced itself upon me, 'Why do
not the mothers of mankind interfere in these matters,
to prevent the waste of that human life of which they
alone bear and know the cost?' I had never thought of
this before. The august dignity of motherhood and its
terrible responsibilities now appeared to me in a new
aspect, and I could think of no better way of expressing
my sense of these than that of sending forth an appeal
to womanhood throughout the world, which I then and
there composed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>This appeal is dated Boston, September, 1870.</p>


<p class="center">APPEAL TO WOMANHOOD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD</p>

<blockquote><p>Again, in the sight of the Christian world, have the skill
and power of two great nations exhausted themselves in
mutual murder. Again have the sacred questions of international
justice been committed to the fatal mediation of military
weapons. In this day of progress, in this century of
light, the ambition of rulers has been allowed to barter the
dear interests of domestic life for the bloody exchanges of
the battle-field. Thus men have done. Thus men will do.
But women need no longer be made a party to proceedings
which fill the globe with grief and horror. Despite the
assumptions of physical force, the mother has a sacred and
commanding word to say to the sons who owe their life to
her suffering. That word should now be heard, and answered
to as never before.</p>

<p>Arise, then, Christian women of this day! Arise, all
women who have hearts, whether your baptism be that of
water or of tears! Say firmly: "We will not have great questions
decided by irrelevant agencies. Our husbands shall not
come to us, reeking with carnage, for caresses and applause.
Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn all that we
have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience.
We, women of one country, will be too tender of those of
another country, to allow our sons to be trained to injure
theirs." From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice
goes up with our own. It says: "Disarm, disarm! The sword
of murder is not the balance of justice." Blood does not
wipe out dishonor, nor violence indicate possession. As men
have often forsaken the plough and the anvil at the summons
of war, let women now leave all that may be left of
home for a great and earnest day of counsel.</p>

<p>Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate
the dead. Let them then solemnly take counsel with
each other as to the means whereby the great human family
can live in peace, man as the brother of man, each bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
after his own kind the sacred impress, not of Cæsar, but of
God.</p>

<p>In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly
ask that a general congress of women, without limit of
nationality, may be appointed and held at some place
deemed most convenient, and at the earliest period consistent
with its objects, to promote the alliance of the different
nationalities, the amicable settlement of international questions,
the great and general interests of peace.</p></blockquote>

<p>The appeal was translated into French, Spanish,
Italian, German, and Swedish, and sent broadcast far
and wide.</p>

<p>In October our mother wrote to Aaron Powell, president
of the American Peace Society: "The issue is one
which will unite virtually the whole sex. God gave us,
I think, the word to say, but it ought to be followed by
immediate and organizing action.... Now, you, my
dear sir, are bound, as a Friend and as an Advocate of
Peace, to take especial interest in this matter, so I call
upon you a little confidently, hoping that you will help
my unbusinesslike and unskilful hands to go on with
this good work. I wish to avoid occasioning any confusion
in the different meetings and organizations of
the Woman Suffrage Movement. But I should wish
to move for various meetings in which the matter of
my appeal, the direct intervention of Woman in the
Pacification of the World, should be discussed, and the
final move of a general Congress promoted. Please
take hold a little now and help me. I have wings but
no feet nor hands&mdash;rather, only a voice, '<i>vox et praeterea
nihil</i>.'"</p>

<p>The next step was to call together those persons supposedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
interested in such a movement. In December,
1870, it was announced that a meeting "for the purpose
of considering and arranging the steps necessary
to be taken for calling a World's Congress of Women
in behalf of International Peace" would be held in
Union League Hall, Madison Avenue and Twenty-sixth
Street, New York, on Friday, December 23. The
announcement, which sets forth the need for and objects
of such a congress, is signed by Julia Ward Howe,
William Cullen Bryant, and Mary F. Davis.</p>

<p>The meeting was an important one: there were
addresses by Lucretia Mott, Octavius Frothingham,
and Alfred Love, the Peace prophet of Philadelphia;
letters from John Stuart Mill, Harriet Beecher Stowe,
and William Howard Furness, who adjures peace-lovers
to "labor for the establishment of a Supreme
Court to which all differences between nations shall be
referred for settlement."</p>

<p>Mrs. Howe made the opening address, from which
we quote these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So I repeat my call and cry to women. Let it pierce
through dirt and rags&mdash;let it pierce through velvet
and cashmere. It is the call of humanity. It says:
'Help others, and you help yourselves.'"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Let the woman seize and bear about the prophetic
word of the hour, and that word becomes flesh, and
dwells among men. This rapturous task of hope, this
perpetual evangel of good news, is the woman's special
business, if she only knew it.</p>

<p>"Patience and passivity are sometimes in place for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
women&mdash;not always. I think of this when I go to
women, intelligent and charming, who warn me off
with white hands, unaccustomed to any graver labor
than that of gesticulation. 'Don't ask me to work,'
they say; 'I cannot do it. God always raises up a set of
people to do these things, like the Anti-Slavery people,
and they set to work to do them.' And then I want to
say to these friends: 'God can raise you up too, and I
hope He will.'</p>

<p>"As for what one can or cannot do, remember that,
active or passive, we must work to live. If we have not
real labor, we must have simulated exercise. If we
have not real objects, we must have fanciful caprices,
little less exertion than keeps us in the padded chair
would take us out of it, and send us to try whether
nature has made any special exemption in our cases,
and whether the paralysis of our life need be traced
further outward than our self-centred heart....</p>

<p>"Would that I were still young, as are many of you;
would at least that I had followed the angel of my
youth as gravely and steadfastly as he invited me; but
the world taught, applauded in another direction, and
I was at fault. But from this assembly a will might go
forth, an earnest will, quick with love, and heavy with
meaning. And this will might say to our sisters all over
the world, 'Trifle no more.' If women did not waste
life in frivolity, men would not waste it in murder. For
the tenderness of the one class is set by God to restrain
the violence of the other."</p>

<p>The New York meeting was followed by one in
Boston. In the spring of 1871 the friends of peace met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
in the rooms of the New England Woman's Club, and
formed an American Branch of the Women's International
Peace Association: Julia Ward Howe, president.
It took five meetings to accomplish this; the minutes
of these meetings are curious and interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. Moncure D. Conway wrote objecting strongly
to the movement being announced as Christian: his
objections were courteously considered.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Mrs. Howe gave her reasons for making her Appeal
in the name of Christianity. She found the doctrine of
peace and forgiveness of injuries the most fundamental
of the Christian doctrines. She thought it proper to
say so, but did not by this prevent the believers in
other religions from asserting the same doctrine, if
considered as existing in those religions."</p>

<p>Mr. Conway's objection was overruled.</p>

<p>The object of the association was "to promote peace,
by the study and culture of its conditions." A "notice"
appended to the constitution announced, "This Association
proposes to hold a World's Congress of Women,
in London, in the summer of 1872, in which undertaking
the cooperation of all persons is earnestly invited."</p>

<p>Before continuing the story of this peace crusade,
we return to the Journal. The volume for 1871 is fragmentary,
the entries mostly brief and far apart.
Written and blank pages are alike significant of the
movement going on in her mind, the steadily growing
desire and resolve to dedicate her life, as her husband
had dedicated his, to the highest needs of humanity.</p>

<p>"<i>January 20.</i> Have been ill all these days. Had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>

of something like this&mdash;a beautiful person splendidly
dressed entering a theatre as I have often done with
entire delight and forgetfulness of everything else, and
the restraining hand of Christ holding me back in the
outer darkness&mdash;the want and woe of the world, and
saying, 'The true drama of life is <i>here</i>.' Oh! that
restraining hand had in it the true touch, communicating
knowledge of human sorrow and zeal for human
service. Never may I escape it to my grave!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"I confess that I value more those processes of
thought which explain history than those which arraign
it. I would not therefore in my advocacy of peace strip
one laurel leaf from the graves so dear and tender in our
recollection. Our brave men did and dared the best
which the time allowed. The sorrow for their loss was
none the less brought upon us by those who believed in
the military method. It is not in injustice to them that
I listen while the Angel of Charity says: 'Behold, I
show you a more excellent way.' Again, 'Come now,
let us reason together, saith the Lord. Though your
sins be as scarlet, they shall be as wool.' This treating
of injuries from the high ground of magnanimity
is the action that shall save the world."</p>

Versailles Government was supposed covertly to represent....
No matter what advantage of reason the
<i>Commune</i> may have had over the Versailles Government,
the <i>Commune</i> committed a civil crime in attempting
military enforcement of its political opinions.
Such was the crime which our South committed and
which we resisted as one defends one's own life. No
overt military act of ours gave them the advantage of
a <i>casus belli</i>. They differed from us and determined to
coerce us forcibly. In that weltering mass of ruin and
corruption which was Paris, what lessons lie of the
utter folly and futility of mutual murder! What hearts
of brothers estranged which time would have harmonized!
What hecatombs of weltering corpses poisoning
the earth which industry should make wholesome!
What women demonized by passion, forgetting all
their woman's lore and skill, the appointed givers of
life speeding death and reaping the bitter fruit themselves!
With this terrible picture before us, let no civilized
nation from henceforth and forever admit or recognize
the instrumentality of war as worthy of Christian
society. Let the fact of human brotherhood be taught
to the babe in his cradle, let it be taught to the despot
on his throne. Let it be the basis and foundation of

more than ever in patience, labor, and sticking to one's

thinking and writing show us only one side of what we
study. Practical life and intercourse with others supply
the other side. If I may sit at work on this day
next year, I hope that my peace matter will have
assumed a practical and useful form, and that I may
have worked out my conception worthily.... I pray
that neither Louis Napoleon nor the Bourbons may
return to feed upon France, but that merciful measures,
surely of God's appointing, may heal her deadly
wounds and uplift her prostrate heart. She must learn

might have intercourse with other women. Christ
showed how men did offend against this same law
which worked so absolutely and partially against
women. An unchaste thought in the breast of the man
infringed the high law of purity. This teaching of the
tender mutual obligations of married life was probably
new to many of his hearers.</p>

<p><br />In the spring of 1872 she went to England, hoping
to hold a Woman's Peace Congress in London. She
also hoped to found and foster "a Woman's Apostolate
of Peace." These hopes were not then to be fulfilled:
yet she always felt that this visit, with all its
labors and its disappointments, was well worth while,
and that much solid good came of it, to herself and
to others.</p>

<p>We have seen her in London as a bride, enjoying to
the full its gayeties and hospitality, as bright a vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
as any that met her eyes, with a companion to whom all
doors opened eagerly. This was the picture of 1843;
that of 1872 is different, indeed.</p>

<p>A woman of middle age, quiet in dress and manner,
with a serene and constant dignity; a face in which the
lines of thought and study were deepening year by
year; eyes now flashing with mirth, now tender with
sympathy, always bright with the "high resolve and
hardihood" for which, but a few years before, she had
been sighing: this was the woman who came to London
in 1872, alone and unaided; who, standing before the
Dark Tower of established Order and Precedent, might
say with Childe Roland,&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Dauntless the slug horn to my lips I set,<br />
And blew."<br />
</p>

<p>She spoke at the banquet of the Unitarian Association.
"The occasion was to me a memorable one."
She hired the Freemasons' Tavern and preached there
on five or six successive Sundays.</p>

<p>"My procedure was very simple,&mdash;a prayer, the
reading of a hymn, and a discourse from a Scripture
text.... The attendance was very good throughout,
and I cherished the hope that I had sown some seed
which would bear fruit hereafter."</p>

<p>She was asked to address meetings in various parts
of England, speaking in Birmingham, Manchester,
Leeds, Bristol, Carlisle, with good acceptance. In
Cambridge she talked with Professor J. R. Seeley,
whom she found most sympathetic. She was everywhere
welcomed by thoughtful people, old friends and
new, whether or no they sympathized with her quest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>"<i>June 9.</i> My first preaching in London. Worked

in my most precious recollection, from the man of

be to minister to human misery, and to redeem
much time and money spent on my own fancies, as I
may...."</p>

<p>She had been asked to attend two important meetings
as American delegate: a peace congress in Paris,
and a great prison reform meeting in London.</p>

<p>The French meeting came first. She crossed the
Channel, reaching Paris in time to attend the principal
<i>séance</i> of the congress. She presented her credentials,
asked leave to speak, and was told "with some embarrassment"
that she might speak to the officers of the
society, when the public meeting should be adjourned!
She makes no comment on this proceeding, but says,
"I accordingly met a dozen or more of these gentlemen
in a side room, where I simply spoke of my endeavors
to enlist the sympathies and efforts of women in behalf
of the world's peace."</p>

<p>Returning to London, she had "the privilege of attending
as a delegate one of the great Prison Reform
meetings of our day."</p>

<p>In 1843, Julia the bride would not have considered
it a privilege to attend a meeting for prison reform.
She would have shrugged her shoulders, would perhaps
have pouted because the Chevalier cared more for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
these things than for the opera, with Grisi, Mario, and
Lablache: she might even have written some funny
verses about the windmill-tilting of her Don Quixote.
Now, she stood in the place that failing health forbade
him to fill, with a depth of interest, an earnestness of
purpose, equal to his own. She, too, now heard the
sorrowful sighing of the prisoners.</p>

<p>At one of the meetings of this congress, a jailer of the
old school spoke in defence of the system of flogging
refractory prisoners, and described in brutal fashion a
brutal incident. Her blood was on fire: she asked leave
to speak.</p>

<p>"It is related," she said, "of the famous Beau
Brummel that a gentleman who called upon him one
morning met a valet carrying away a tray of neck-cloths,
more or less disordered. 'What are these?'
asked the visitor; and the servant replied, 'These are
our failures!' When I see the dark coach which in our
country carries the criminal to his place of detention,
I say, 'Society, here are your failures.'"</p>

<p>Her words were loudly applauded, and the punishment
was voted down.</p>

<p>The Journal gives her further speech on this occasion:
"Spoke of justice to women. They had talked of
fallen women. I prayed them to leave that hopeless
phrase. Every fallen woman represents a man as
guilty as herself, who escapes human detection, but
whose soul lies open before God. Speak of vicious, dissolute
women, but don't speak of fallen women unless
you recognize the fall of man, the old doctrine."</p>

<p>Two days before this she had preached her last sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
in London. The Journal says: "All Sunday at
work upon my sermon, the last in London. 'Neither
height nor depth, nor any other creature.' The sermon
of high and low, and the great unity beyond all dimensions.
A good and to me a most happy delivery of
opinions and faith which I deeply hold.... So ended
my happy ministration in London, begun in fear and
anxiety, ended in certainty and renewed faith, which
God continue to me."</p>

<p>August found her back at Oak Glen, exhausted in
body and mind. She is almost too tired to write in the
Journal, and such entries as there are only accentuate
her fatigue.</p>

<p>"I am here at my table with books and papers, but
feel very languid. My arms feel as if there were no
marrow in their bones. I suppose this is reaction after
so much work, but unless I can get up strength somehow
I shall not accomplish anything. Weakness in all
my limbs. Have had my Greek lesson and begun to
read the Maccabees and the Apocrypha. I shall probably
come up after a few days, but feel at present
utterly incapable of exertion. I must help Maud&mdash;have
helped her with music to-day...."</p>

<p>"Walked about with dear Chev, whose talk is
always instructive. Every break in our long-continued
habits shows us something to amend in our past lives.
What do I see in mine after this long break? That I
must endeavor to have more real life and more religion.
The passive and contemplative following of thought,
my own or other people's, must not de-energize my
sympathies and my will. I must daily consult the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
divine will and standard which can help us to mould
our lives aright without running from one extreme to
another. My heart's wish would now be to devote
myself to some sort of religious ministration. God can
open a way for this in which the spirit of my desire may
receive the form of his will. I must lecture this winter
to earn some money and spread, I hope, some good
doctrine...."</p>



<p><br />Such was the beginning of her work for peace, which
was to end only with her life. Disappointed in her hope
of a world congress, she turned the current of her effort
in a new direction. She would have a festival, a day
which should be called Mothers' Day, and be devoted
to the advocacy of peace doctrines. She chose
the second day of June; for many years she and her
friends and followers kept this day religiously, with
sweet and tender observances which were unspeakably
dear to her.</p>

<p>In 1876 there was a great peace meeting in Philadelphia.
The occasion is thus described by the Reverend
Ada C. Bowles: "There were delegates from
France, Italy, and Germany, each with a burning desire
to be heard, and all worth hearing, but none able to
speak English. The audience looked to the anxious
face of the President with sympathy; then a voice was
heard, 'Call for Mrs. Howe.' Those present will never
forget how her presence changed the meeting from a
threatened failure to a noble success. The German,
Frenchman, and Italian stood in turn by her side. At
the proper moment she lifted a finger, and then gave in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
her perfect English each speech in full to the delight
of the delegates and the admiration of all."</p>

<p>The last celebration of her Mothers' Day was held
in Riverton, New Jersey, on June 1, 1912, by the
Pennsylvania Peace Society, in conjunction with the
Universal Peace Union. On the printed invitation to
this festival we read</p>

<p>
"Aid it, paper, aid it, pen,<br />
Aid it, hearts of earnest men.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Julia Ward Howe, 1874."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And further on, "Thirty-nine years ago Julia Ward
Howe instituted this festival for peace,&mdash;a time for the
women and children to come together; to meet in
the country, invite the public, and recite, speak, sing
and pray for 'those things that make for peace.'"</p>

<p><br />We must go back a little to tell another story.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1870-71 the Republic of Santo
Domingo sent through its president an urgent request
for annexation to the United States. President Grant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
appointed a commission to visit this island republic,
to inquire into its conditions and report upon the question.
Of this commission Dr. Howe was one, the others
being Messrs. Benjamin Wade and Andrew D. White.</p>

<p>The commissioners sailed on the government steamer
Tennessee. At parting the Doctor said, "Remember
that you cannot hear from us under a month; so do not
be frightened at our long silence."</p>

<p>A week later came reports of a severe storm in the
Southern seas. A large steamer had been seen struggling
with wind and wave, apparently at their mercy.
Some newspaper thought it might be the Tennessee.
All the newspapers took up the cry: it probably <i>was</i>
the Tennessee; most likely she had foundered and gone
down with all on board.</p>

<p>Mindful of the Doctor's warning, our mother tried
to disregard these voices of terror. She went quietly
about her work as usual, but none the less the days of
suspense that followed were "dark indeed and hard to
live through."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>We remember these days well, the resolute cheerfulness,
the avoidance of outward sign of anxiety, the
sudden lifting of the cloud when the good news came
of the steamer's safe arrival.</p>

<p>The prayer of Santo Domingo was not to be answered,
spite of the favorable report of the commission:
but the Doctor had been so delighted with the island
that when, a year later, he was asked to visit it in
the interests of the Samana Bay Company, he gladly
accepted the commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>This time our mother went with him, together with
Maud and a party of friends. She had been loth to go,
for she had already planned her peace crusade in England,
but finding how much he desired it, she compromised
on part of the time.</p>

<p>They sailed from New York early in February, 1872,
in the steamer Tybee. The voyage was rough and
stormy. The companion daughter of the time remembers
how the wretched little Tybee pitched and heaved;
even more vividly she recalls the way in which our
mother from the first made society out of the strangely
assorted company on board. She was the magnet, and
drew them all to her: the group of conventional ladies
who had never before been at sea, the knot of naval
officers going to join their ship,&mdash;among them George
W. De Long, the hero of the ill-fated Jeannette expedition;
a colonel, and a judge, the former interested in
the Samana Bay Company. She made out of this odd
company and the gruff old captain a sort of court
which she ruled in a curious way. She did not seem
to compel their admiration so much as to compel
each to give his best.</p>

<p>The Tybee cast anchor in the harbor of Puerto
Plata, and the voyagers saw Mont Isabel towering
above them, its foot in the clear beryl water where the
palms grew down to the very edge of the yellow sea
sand, its head wrapped in the clouds. The Doctor came
to the stateroom, crying, "Come up and see the great
glory!"</p>

<p>Our mother's delight can be imagined when they
sailed into the harbor of Santo Domingo and landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
near an immense and immemorial tree, where, they
were told, Columbus had landed.</p>

<p>The party lodged in a fine old Spanish <i>palacio</i>, built
round a courtyard. It had been originally a convent.
The nuns were gone, and their place was now taken
by the gay company of American ladies, who possibly
gave the sleepy little city more new ideas than it had
ever received in so short a space of time. President
Baez put the palace at the Doctor's disposal; he was
an important person to the President and to the
Dominicans, for at that time the hope of annexation
had not died out. All the party were treated with
extraordinary courtesy. Not only were they given the
presidential palace to live in, but a guard of honor was
kept in the courtyard. Their horses were lodged, Spanish
fashion, on the ground floor. The trampling, the
neighing, and the fleas made them rather uncomfortable
neighbors. Our mother soon found out that the
only way she could see the country, or enjoy its life,
was by riding. At first she was a little nervous, but
she soon regained her courage and her seat. This was
her first riding since the days of Cora, the wicked little
mare, when she read her Bible and said her prayers
before every ride. She thus describes it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Santo Domingo, nothing is more charming than
the afternoon ride. It is, of course, the great event
of the neighborhood. Our cavalcade usually numbers
four or five ladies. Sometimes we cross the river in a
flat-bottomed boat, which is pulled over by a rope
stretched and made fast at either end. We then visit
the little village of Pajarita, and trot along under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the shade of heavy mango trees. Or we explore the
country on this side the river. The great thing to
guard against is the danger of rain. This we encountered
one afternoon in some severity. Suddenly one of
the party cried '<i>Llava!</i>' and down came the waters.
We were somewhat heated with our ride, and the penetrating
rain fell chill upon us. A large tree gave us
shelter for a few moments, but we were soon forced to
seek more effectual protection. This we found, after
some delay, in a <i>boio</i>, or hut, into which horses and
riders were dragged pell-mell. The night was closing
in, the Chief at home, and presumably anxious, the
rain unabating. Which of the tropical spasms would
end our far-spent life? Would it be lockjaw, a common
result of severe chill in these regions? Would it be
a burning, delirious fever with a touch of yellow; or
should we get off with croup and diphtheria?</p>

<p>"The rain presently stopped, and we returned to
the saddle, and then, by easy stages, to the city. On
reaching home, we were advised to bathe the chilled
surfaces with rum, not the wicked New England article,
but the milder product of the country. Of all the
evil consequences spoken of as sure to follow such an
exposure, fever, lockjaw, and sore throat, we have so
far not seen the earliest symptom."</p>

<p>It was Carnival. All the cabinet officers and their
wives devoted themselves to the entertainment of the
party. The Minister of War, Señor Curiel, a little
twinkling fiery man, devoted himself especially to our
mother, and was her right hand in the many expeditions
she arranged. The Secretary of State, Señor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Gautier, a grave person with more culture than most
of the Dominicans, was the Doctor's chosen friend.
To return the many attentions showered upon them,
a ball in the old convent was arranged. The Doctor
once said to her, "If you were on a desert island with
nobody there but one old darkey, you would give a
party." (But it was from Cuba that he wrote, "Julia
knows three words of Spanish, and is constantly
engaged in active conversation.")</p>

<p>To find herself at Carnival, the leader of a gay party,
living in a spacious palace, supported by the guns and
the officers of an American warship (the Narragansett,
with De Long and other officers on board), was an
opportunity not to be missed. She thus describes the
entertainment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Hans Breitmann gife a barty.</i></p>

<p>"So did we. To see Santo Domingo was little, without
seeing the Dominicans also. Some diplomatic overtures
were made. Would the first families come and
pass an evening with us at the <i>Palacio</i>? Yes, they
would. Which <i>were</i> the first families? That would
have been for us a point very difficult to determine.
The family of the President and those of the heads of
departments would certainly stand in that prominence.
For the necessary beaux we were referred to a society
recently established here, calling itself '<i>La Juventad</i>,'
'the young people.' This body of philanthropists, being
appealed to, consented to undertake the management
of our party. The occasion was announced as a
<i>bailecita</i>, 'little ball.' We asked them to provide such
refreshments as are customary in this place. Thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
dollars' worth of sweet cake and a bottled ocean of
weak beer formed the principal items of the bill, as
brought to us. The friends came at 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, to decorate
the room with flowers, also to arrange two tables, on
one of which <i>las dulces</i> were arrayed, while the other
was made to display a suspicious-looking group of
glasses. A band, we were told, would be indispensable.
We demurred at this, having intended to musicate
upon our own grand piano. Hearing, however, that
the band could be had for the sum of twelve dollars,
we gave in on this point.</p>

<p>"One long room runs the whole length of one side of
the palace, and serves us at once for dining and reception
room. A long corridor encounters this room at
right angles, entirely open to the weather, on one side.
These two spaces constitute all our resources for receiving
company. We lit them with Downer's best [kerosene]
and ranged rows of rocking-chairs, opposite to
each other, after the manner of this country, and also
of Cuba.</p>

<p>"The company began to arrive at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The young
ladies were mostly attired in colored tarlatans, prettily
trimmed with lace and flowers. Some of them were not
over fourteen years of age. All were quite youthful
in their appearance, and unaffected in their manners.
The young men, mostly employed in the various shops
of the city, were well-dressed and polite. The band
was somewhat barbaric in its aspect. A violin, a 'cello,
a tambourine, and a clarinet. The clarinet-player was
of uncommon size, with wild, dark eyes, which seemed
to dilate as he played....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>"The dancing continued with little interruption
until nearly 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> We were told that it is often continued
till daylight. From time to time an attack was
made upon the two tables. But the enjoyment of the
good things provided was quite moderate compared
with the cramming of a first-class party in Boston or
New York. The guests were of many shades, as to
color, although the greater number would have passed
for white people, anywhere. Some of the handsomest
among them were very dark. One young man reminded
us of Edwin Booth in "Othello."... None of these people
look like the mulattoes in the North. The features
and the fibre appear finer, and the jet-black hair often
suggests an admixture of Indian blood. The difference
of social position shows itself in the manners of these
people. The cruel colorphobia has never proscribed
them. They have no artificial sense of inferiority, but
take themselves as God made them, and think that
if He is content with their complexions, mankind at
large may be so.</p>

<p>"We were much pleased with our party, and with
the simple and unaffected gayety of our guests. It was
really a party in the open air, one whole side of our
ballroom being unenclosed, save by the infrequent colonnade.
We looked from the dancers to the stars, and
back again to the dancers. It was all fairylike and
dreamlike. The favorite '<i>dansa</i>' much resembles, not
a ballet, but a stage dance, such as is introduced in the
course of the drama. The beer flowed, and the couples
flew. One innovation we introduced, a Virginia reel,
which the clever clarinet-player caught and accompanied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
The figures much amazed the natives. The
<i>dénouement</i> of Mr. Leland's classic ballad was wanting.
No</p>

<p>
"'Gompany fited mit daple lecks<br />
Till de coonshtable made em shtop';<br />

<p>yet we may quote further from that high source:&mdash;</p>

"'Hans Breitmann gife a barty,<br />

<p>The Journal gives pleasant glimpses of the Santo
Domingo days.</p>

<p>"M. Marne, a Frenchman ninety-seven years old,
paid us a visit. Had been secretary of Joseph Buonaparte
in Madrid&mdash;praised him much. Talked very
copiously and not ill. Enjoys full mental and physical
activity. Lives at a small village in sight of our windows,
but on the other side of the river. Talked much
of the Roi Cristophe."</p>

<p>The mention of this old gentleman recalls her visit
to a Dominican <i>padre</i>, himself in extreme age, who told
her that he had known a negress who lived to the age
of one hundred and forty-three; he had confessed and
buried her. "She had her teeth and her hair still."</p>

<p>"Not to market to-day, but breakfast early&mdash;then
all hands to the cathedral to see the high mass performed&mdash;to-day
in honor of the independence of the
island....</p>

<p>"Baez' face, cunning, pretty strong, <i>enjoué</i>, as if he
must be, or seem, a <i>bon enfant</i>.... The noise at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
elevation of the Host a perfect Babel. Music, 'Ernani,'
'Fra Diavolo,' with some similar things. A single
trumpet shrieked at some high moments. The bells
rang like a thousand tin pans. Orchestra and chorus
not together and both out of tune. The ceremony
otherwise perhaps as well as usual. A priest made a
brief address in Spanish, praising the day and complimenting
the President...."</p>

<p>"Studied Baur, Aristophanes, and '<i>Etudes sur la
Bible</i>.' Music lesson to Maud. O'Sullivan to dine....
Baez sent word that he would visit us between 5 and 6
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> We accordingly put things in the best order possible
under the circumstances. <i>Ung puo de tualetta</i> for
the ladies seemed proper. At dinner received Baez'
card with a great dish of fine sapotes. Baez arrived.
He speaks French quite tolerably, is affable, and has
an intelligent face; in fact looks like a person of marked
talent. We talked of things in the United States. He
has made fourteen voyages to Europe.... I sang '<i>Una
Barchetta</i>' for him. He came with one servant, who
stayed outside&mdash;no ceremony and no escort...."</p>

<p>After the beauty of the place&mdash;indeed possibly before
it&mdash;she valued the opportunity that came to her
of preaching. On the voyage to Santo Domingo she
had learned of a shepherdless flock of colored Protestants,
their minister dead, their "elder" disabled by
lameness. Here was an opportunity not to be lost.
She engaged to hold Sunday evening services in their
church, a small wooden building with a mud floor and
a mahogany pulpit. The "Reminiscences" describe
these services; the tattered hymn-books whose leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
were turned mechanically while the congregation (few
of whom could read) sang with a will the hymns they
knew by heart; the humble, devout people with their
attentive faces.</p>

<p>When Holy Week came, the congregation begged her
to hold special services. They wished their young people
to understand that these sacred days meant as
much to them as to the surrounding Catholics. Accordingly
she and her companion "dressed the little
church with flowers. It looked charmingly. Flowers
all along the railing [here follows in the Journal a pen-and-ink
sketch], flowers in the pulpit over my head.
Church was crowded. Many people outside and at the
windows."</p>

<p>She always remembered with pleasure one feature
of her Easter sermon, her attempt to describe Dante's
vision of a great cross in the heavens, formed of star
clusters, each cluster bearing the name of Christ. "The
thought," she says, "that the mighty poet of the fourteenth
century should have something to impart to
these illiterate negroes was very dear to me."</p>

<p>One of the party has an undying impression of this
Easter service: the shabby little chapel crowded with
dark faces, and the preacher, standing touched by a
ray of sunlight, speaking to that congregation of simple
black people. In her notes she speaks of these
services.</p>

<p>"A pastoral charge bringing me near to the hearts
and sympathies of the people. I have preached five
times in the little church, including Good Friday and
Easter Monday. This service, which has not been without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
its difficulties, is so much better to me in remembrance
than anything else I have done here that I must
make a little break and pause before I speak of other
things.</p>

<p>"In this pause I remember my prayer at Puerto
Plata, that I and mine might come to this new region
with a reverent and teachable spirit. That prayer was
an earnest one to me. I hope it has, as all prayers
should, accomplished its own fulfilment. I have been
here among dear people. I find all the human varieties
in this society, not digested and harmonized by noble
culture, but existing and asking for the centralizing
and discriminating agencies which in civilization sort
out the different tastes, characters, and capacities, and
assign to each its task, giving devotion its wings and
crime its treadmill. This little population in a great
country, a country in which Nature allows no one to
starve, has lived and so shown its right to live and maintain
itself. It has accomplished its political division
from a state antipathetic to it, having its dark face
turned fixedly towards barbarism [Hayti].</p>

<p>"I stood in a little church in the city and island of
Santo Domingo, to preach the glad tidings of the gospel
of Peace. It was a humble little temple, with a mud
floor, and plastered walls, and a roof which scarcely
kept out the rain, but it was a place full of comfort to
me and to others. The seats and spaces were all filled,
for it had no aisles. The small windows and doors were
cushioned, so to speak, with human countenances,
wearing an expression of curiosity or attention. The
way to the church was lined on both sides with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
simple people, who held their service at night because
the poverty of their attire made them ashamed to hold
it by day. And this crowd came together, Sunday after
Sunday, because a woman from a distant country stood
in that little church to tell them what a woman can tell
about the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>Loth as she had been to go to Santo Domingo, she
was far more loth to leave it; but the time appointed
for her peace crusade in London was at hand, and she
could tarry no longer. On April 5 she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! my time is nearly out. Dear Santo Domingo,
how I do love you, with your childish life, and your
ancestral streets&mdash;a grandam and a babe! To-day I
read my last in Baur and Greek for some time, probably,
as must pack to-morrow. As at present advised,
God grant that we may come here again."</p>

<p>"<i>April 6.</i> Here to-day and gone to-morrow, literally.
Mostly packed&mdash;have left out my books for a
last sweet morsel.... Did not get that sweet morsel.
Was busy all day&mdash;farewell calls from friends, little
talks, and the fear of sitting down and forgetting my
preparations in my books. In the evening the Gautiers
came and I played for them to dance. So, one last
little gayety in common."</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday, April 7.</i> Got up at 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Dressed and got
off pretty easily.... The parting from Maud was very
hard. Oh! when the line was drawn in, and my darling
and I were fairly sundered, my old heart gave way, and
I cried bitterly....</p>

<p>"Henry Blackwell is a dear, comforting man, most
kind and companionable. A woman on board with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
wretched baby of six months, he in a muslin gown and
nothing else, crying with cold. I got out a cotton flannel
dressing-sack, and wrapped him up in it and tended
him a good deal....</p>

<p>"May the purpose for which I undertake this painful
and solitary journey be ever strong enough in my
thoughts to render every step of it pure, blameless and
worthy. Great God, do not let me desert thee! For
that is the trouble. Thou dost not desert us. I dread
unspeakably these dark days of suffering and confusion.
To go is like being hanged...."</p>

<p>"Captain said something about my preaching on
Sunday, so I have been laying out some points for a
sermon.... But it is not very likely that the Captain
will really ask me to hold service.</p>

<p>"Talk with purser about Homer. He has a vivacious
mind, and might easily learn Greek, or anything else he
would have a mind to."</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday.</i> It turned out that the Captain and passengers
did wish me to hold a little service to-day, so
at 10.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> I met them in the dining-saloon. I had a
Bible, from which I read the 116th Psalm&mdash;a prayer
followed&mdash;then the missionary hymn, 'From Greenland's
icy mountains'&mdash;then my little sermon, of
which I have the headings. I am so very glad to have
been able and enabled to do this.</p>

<p>"Began to teach the purser to read from notes with
a leaf of music out of some periodical. Copied Baur a
little&mdash;talked and heard much talk."</p>

<p>"<i>April 17....</i> Expect to get in to-morrow, not very
late, unless another contrary gale. Frigate birds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
petrels yesterday&mdash;to-day, whales, blackfish, and an
immense number of porpoises. Revelation cannot go
beyond human consciousness.</p>

<p>"The Western mind has taken Christ's metaphorical
illustrations literally, and his literal moral precepts
metaphorically."</p>

<p>"<i>April 18....</i> Very thankful to have got through
so well so far."</p>


<p><br />As at the beginning of this chapter we took a step
backward, so we must now take one forward and speak
briefly of the second visit to Santo Domingo in 1874.</p>

<p>The Doctor's health was failing; he had suffered
from the winter's cold, and longed for the warm sunshine
of the beloved island. Would she go with him?
he asked. She should preach to her colored folks as
much as she liked.</p>

<p>They sailed together in the Tybee in March. After
a brief visit to the capital (where Revolution had been
before them, expelling the friendly Baez, and putting
in his place a man opposed to the Samana Bay Company),
they took up their quarters at Samana, in a
little hillside cottage about a mile from the town.</p>

<p>Our mother writes in her Journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>March 20.</i> In Santo Domingo as glad as a child....
Went to Garcia's and foolishly bargained for the gold
necklace and emerald ring I fancied the last time I was
here. The necklace is for Maud."</p>

<p>The love of jewelry was one of the "little passions"
of her whole life. Speaking once of this as her "besetting
sin," she said: "It is rather respectable to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
besetting sin, as it shows one must have had an ancestor
from whom it was inherited!" She enjoyed a jewel
as she did a flower or a song: she loved to deck her dear
ones and herself with trinkets; a jeweller's window was
a thing of delight to her, not to be passed without the
tribute of a pause and a glance at its treasures. Yet a
purchase of this kind seldom failed to bring its retributive
pang the day after.</p>

<p>"Was sorry to have made so foolish a use of the
money. Resolve never to do so again, unless some new
light should make it seem right. God will not have my
mind occupied with such nonsense.... Have written
my sermon for to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>They spent two months in Samana in almost absolute
retirement. The Doctor read "Don Quixote" in
Spanish, she Aristotle in Greek and Baur in German.
The former "was early and late in the saddle, and
dashed up and down the steep hillsides of Samana with
all his old fearlessness." The latter followed as she
might, "in perils and dangers, in terrors often."</p>

<p>"I had never been a bold rider, and I must confess
that I suffered agonies of fear in following him on these
expeditions. If I lagged behind, he would cry, 'Come
on! it's as bad as going to a funeral to ride with you.'
And so, I suppose, it was. I remember one day when
a great palm branch had fallen across our path. I
thought that my horse would certainly slip on it, sending
me to the depths below. That very day, while Dr.
Howe took his siesta, I went to the place where this
impediment lay, and with a great effort threw it over
the steep mountain-side. The whole neighborhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of Samana is very mountainous, and I sometimes
found it impossible to obey the word of command. One
day my husband spurred his horse and made a gallant
dash at a very steep ascent, ordering me to follow him.
I tried my best, but only got far enough to find myself
awkwardly at a standstill, and unable to go either backward
or forward. The Doctor was obliged to dismount
and to lead my horse down to the level ground. This,
he assured me, was a severe mortification for him."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the permission given, she spoke only a
few times in Samana. She tells of an open-air service
in which she took part. She arrived late, and found a
zealous elder holding forth and "reading" from a Bible
held upside down. At sight of her he said, "And now
dat de lady hab come, I will obdunk from de place!"</p>

<p>One day she spoke to the pupils of a little school
kept by an English carpenter, who studied Greek in
order to understand the New Testament, yet allowed
his pupils to use the small <i>i</i> for the personal pronoun.
The schoolhouse was perched on a hill so steep that she
was thankful to mount astride on a huge white steer
furnished with a straw saddle, and be led up by a
friendly neighbor.</p>

<p>In these days the ill-fated Samana Bay Company, of
which the Doctor and many others had had high hopes,
came to an end, and the Dominican Government insisted
that its flag should be officially withdrawn. Our
mother describes the incident:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To town early to be present at the taking down of
the Samana Company's flag by the commission sent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
board the Dominican war schooner. I went in the boat
and found Chev in the custom-house with the commission
seated around. A good many of our people present.
Chev read his protest, which was strong and
simple.... We then went out of the building; the
<i>employés</i> of our Company marched up in their best
clothes, their hats stuck full of roses, and stood in order
on either side the flagstaff. The man ordered by the
commission lowered the flag. Just before, Chev got
our people to stand in a circle around him, made a
lovely little address. The old Crusader never appeared
nobler or better than on this occasion, when his beautiful
chivalry stood in the greatest contrast to the barbarism
and ingratitude which dictated this act. My
mind was full of cursing rather than blessing. Yet finding
myself presently alone with the superseded flag I
laid my hand upon it and prayed that if I had power to
bless anything, my prayers might bless the good effort
which has been made here."</p>

<p>On April 2 she adds: "The blacks here say that the
taking down of our flag was like the crucifixion of our
Lord. We are assured that they would have offered
forcible resistance, if we had authorized their so doing."</p>

<p>"<i>May 9.</i> The last day of our last week in Samana....
God knows when I shall have so much restful leisure
again. My rides on horseback, too, are ended for
the present, though I may mount once more to-day or
to-morrow. All these pleasures have been mixed with
pains&mdash;my fear on horseback ... but far more than
all, my anxiety about the dearest ones at home. The
affairs of the Company, too, have given me many sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
thoughts, but in spite of all this the time has been a
blessed one. I have improved in mind and body, if not
in estate&mdash;have had sweet leisure for thought and
study, opportunity to preach the gospel (three times),
and most invigorating air and exercise. Over the door
of the little parlor here hangs a motto: 'God bless our
Home.' I think, indeed, He has blessed this little home,
though, at first, when I looked at the motto, I always
thought of my own home."</p>

<p>The next day they saw the "last of beautiful Samana
for the present," and ten days later found them in New
York. Her final word on this brief and lovely episode
is given in the Journal for May 24: "My heart sinks
whenever Chev says he will never go to Samana again.
'There are my young barbarians all at play.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE LAST OF GREEN PEACE</h3>

<h4>1872-1876; <i>aet.</i> 53-57</h4>

<p>
He who launched thee a bolt of fire<br />
Strong in courage and in desire<br />
Takes thee again a weapon true<br />
In heaven's armory ever new.<br />
<br />
Still shall the masterful fight go on,<br />
Still shall the battle of Right be won<br />
And He who fixed thee in upper air<br />
Shall carry thy prowess otherwhere.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">J. W. H.</span><br />
</p>


<p><br />As our father's health failed more and more, his
heart turned to the home he had made. He longed for
Green Peace; and&mdash;the lease falling in about this
time&mdash;in the spring of 1872 he and our mother and
Maud moved thither, and took up their quarters in the
"new part," while Laura and her husband came to
occupy the old. Here the first grandchild (Alice Maud
Richards) was born; here and at Oak Glen the next
four years were mainly passed.</p>

<p>The Doctor's ardent spirit longed for new fields of
work, new causes to help; the earthly part could not
follow. How he struggled, toiling, suffering, fighting
the good fight to his last breath, has been told elsewhere:<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
suffice it to say that these years were grave
ones for the household, spite of new joys that dawned
for all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>The grandchildren opened a new world for both our
parents: a world which one was to enjoy for a space all
too brief, the other through long years, in which she
was to be to the youngest generation a lamp of wisdom,
a flame of warmth and tenderness, a fountain
of joy.</p>

<p>Among the memory pictures of this time is one of her
sitting at her desk, laboring at her endless correspondence;
beside her, on the floor, the baby of the period,
equally absorbed in the contents of the waste-paper
basket.</p>

<p>Or we see the tall figure of the Doctor, stooping in
the doorway between the two houses, a crowing child
on his shoulders, old face and young alight with merriment.
These were Richards grandbabes; the Hall
children were the summer delight of the grandparents,
as they and their mother usually spent the summer at
Oak Glen.</p>


<p><br />"<i>Friday, September 13.</i> Before I open even my New
Testament to-day, I must make record of the joyful
birth of Flossy's little son [Samuel Prescott Hall]....
God bless this dear little child! May he bring peace
and love....</p>

<p>"During the confinement I could not think of anything
divine or spiritual. It was Nature's grim, mechanical,
traditional task. But now that it is over,
my heart remembers that Life is not precious without
God, and the living soul just given stands related to
the quickening spirit."</p>

<p>"...I can get little time for study, as I must help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
nurse dear Flossy. My mind is strangely divided between
my dear work and my dear child and grandchild.
I must try to keep along with both, but on no account
to neglect the precious grandchild."</p>

<p>"<i>October 1.</i> O year! thou art running low. The last
trimester."</p>

<p>"<i>October 2.</i> This day, thirty-two years ago, my dearest
brother Henry died in my arms, the most agonizing
experience. Never again did Death so enter into my
heart, until my lovely son of three years departed many
years later, leaving a blank as sad and bitter. Henry
was a rare and delicate person.... His life was a most
valuable one to us for help and counsel, as well as
for affection. Perhaps no one to-day thinks about his
death except me, his junior by two years, wearing now
into the decline of life. Dear brother, I look forward
to the reunion with you, but wish my record were
whiter and brighter."</p>

<p>"<i>October 5.</i> Boston. Came up for directors' meeting
of New England Woman's Club. Went afterward to
Mrs. Cheney's lecture on English literature.... A
suggestive and interesting essay, which I was glad to
hear and have others hear. It gave me a little pain,
that, though she pleasantly alluded to me as one who
has laid aside the laurel for the olive branch, she said
nothing whatever about my writings, which deserve
to be spoken of in characterizing the current literature
of the day; but she perhaps does not read or like my
works, and besides, people think of me nowadays more
as an active woman's woman than as a literary character,
as the phrase is. All life is full of trial, and when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
hear literary performance praised, and remember my
own love for it, and for praise, I think a little how much
of all this I have sacrificed in these later years for a service
that has made me enemies as well as friends. I felt
called upon to do this, and I still think that if I made a
mistake, it was one of those honest mistakes it is best
to make."</p>


<p><br />She was giving Maud music lessons this autumn,
reading Plutarch with her, taking her to parties and
giving parties for her. Later, we find her holding mission
services at Vineyard Haven; addressing the Saturday
Morning Club ("Subject&mdash;<i>Object</i>: I smile at
this antithesis"); delivering a lecture at Albany&mdash;with
the lecture left behind.</p>

<p>"Got to work at once making abstracts from memory....
Spoke more than an hour.... Got my money&mdash;would
rather have paid it than have had such an
experience. Felt as if my inner Guide had misled and
deserted me. But some good to some one may come
of what I said and tried to say."</p>

<p>She returned from this trip very weary, only to find
"my lecture advertised, not one line of it written&mdash;subject,
'Men's Women and Women's Women.' Set
to work at once, almost overpowered by the task, and
the shortness of the time."</p>

<p>The lecture was finished in the morning, delivered
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Warm congratulations at the close.... Such a
sense of relief!"</p>

<p>On December 19 she notes the departure of "dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Flossy and her dearest little Boy.... House very desolate
without them. This boy is especially dear to
Doctor Howe and myself."</p>

<p>"<i>December 28.</i> Maria Mitchell's Club lecture to-day
was beautiful exceedingly. I might have envied her
the steady grasp and unbroken advance of scientific
study, did I not feel sure that God gives to each his
own work. Mine, such as it is, would be helped and
beautified by the knowledge which she imparts so
easily, but perhaps all of her that I shall remember
and try to follow is her spirit. Her silver hair seems
lustrous with spiritual brightness, as do her dark eyes.
Her movements are full of womanly grace, not ballroom
grace."</p>

<p><br />From now on the movement is <i>sempre crescendo</i>.
Work for peace, work for clubs; lecturing, preaching,
tending the Doctor in his days of illness; taking the
youngest daughter to balls and parties; founding a
club for her, too. She felt that the young girls of
Maud's age needed the onward impulse as much as
their elders; accordingly, in November, 1871, she called
together a meeting of young women, and with their
aid and good-will formed the Saturday Morning Club
of Boston. The energy with which this organization
sprang into being showed that the time was ripe for it.
That energy, handed on through two generations, is no
less lively to-day; the name of the club recalls a hundred
beautiful and interesting occasions.</p>

<p>The Journal hurries us on from day to arduous day.
Even the aspiration of New Year's Day, 1873, breathes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the note of hurry: "Dear Lord, let me this year be
worthy to call upon thy name!"</p>

<p>February 5 finds her on another quest: "Mem.
Never to come by this route again. Had to turn out at
Utica at 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Three hours in depot...."</p>

<p>"<i>March 1.</i> Went to Saturday Morning Club.
Found that John Fiske had failed them. Was told to
improvise a lecture on the spot. Did so...."</p>

<p>"<i>March 5.</i> Went to hear the arguments in favor
of rescinding the vote of censure against Charles
Sumner...."</p>

<p>[In 1872, Sumner introduced in the Senate of the
United States a resolution that the names of battles
with fellow-countrymen should not be continued in the
Army Register, nor placed on the regimental colors of
the United States. This measure was violently opposed;
the Legislature of Massachusetts denounced it
as "an insult to the loyal soldiery of the Nation, ...
meeting the unqualified condemnation of the Commonwealth."
For more than a year Sumner's friends,
headed by John G. Whittier, strove to obtain the
rescinding of this censure; it was not till 1874 that it
was rescinded by a large majority.]</p>

<p>"<i>March 10.</i> A morning for work in my own room, so
rare a luxury that I hardly know how to use it. Begin
with my Greek Testament...."</p>

<p>"<i>March 17.</i> Radical Club.... It was an interesting
sitting, but I felt as if the Club had about done its
work. People get to believing that talk turns the world:
it is much, but it is nothing without work...."</p>

<p>"<i>May 27.</i> Fifty-four years old to-day. Thank God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
for what I have had and hope to have.... In the
afternoon my dear children had a beautiful birthday
party for me, including most of my old friends and
some of the newer ones. Agassiz came, and his wife;
he brought a bouquet and kissed me. I had beautiful
flowers.... Poor Chev was ill with a frightful headache.
I was much touched by the dear children's affectionate
device and shall remember this birthday."</p>

<p>This was the first of the Birthday Receptions, which
were to be our happiest festivals through many happy
years.</p>

<p>Monday, June 2, was the day she had appointed
as Mothers' Peace Day, her annual Peace Festival.</p>

<p>"The day of many prayers dawned propitious, and
was as bright and clear as I could have wished."</p>

<p>She was up early, and found the hall "beautifully
decorated with many fine bouquets, wreaths, and baskets,
the white dove of Peace rising above other
emblems." There were two services, morning and
evening, and many speakers. "Mr. Tilden and Mr.
Garrison both did nobly for me.... Thank God for so
much!"</p>

<p>She had the great joy of hearing that the day was
celebrated in other countries besides her own. In London,
Geneva, Constantinople, and various other places,
services were held, and men and women prayed and
sang in behalf of peace: this she counted among the precious
things of the year, and of several years to come.</p>

<p>"<i>June 6.</i> Quiet at last, and face to face with the
eternal Gospel. Weary and confused, anxious to wind
up my business well, and begin my polyglot sheet...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>Yet on June 10 she is arriving in New York at 5.40
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, bound for a peace meeting.</p>

<p>"<i>June 11.</i> I got two bricks from the dear old house
at the corner of Broadway and Bond Street, now all
down and rebuilding. Will have one enamelled for
myself. Ah, Lord, what a bitter lesson is in this tearing-down!
How I was wanting in duty to the noble parent
who built this grand home for me! I hope to help
young people to understand something of parental
love and its responsibilities. But parents also must
study children, since each new soul may require a
new method."</p>

<p>"<i>June 12.</i> Home very gladly. Helped Maud with
her Latin. At 3.30 to rehearse 'Midsummer-Night's
Dream.' I Hermia and Snout. At 7.30 the reading,
which was the pleasantest we have had."</p>

<p>[These readings were in the vestry of the Church of
the Disciples. Mr. Clarke, our mother, Erving Winslow,
and others of the congregation took part: we
remember the late Professor James Mills Pierce as
Orlando in "As You Like It"; his beautiful reading of
the part contrasting oddly with his middle-aged, long-bearded
personality. Our mother's rendering of Maria
in "Twelfth Night" was something to remember.]</p>

<p>"<i>June 17.</i> Up at five and to get a boat. Maud and
the Lieutenant [Zalinski] rowed me to Fort Independence
and back, a most refreshing excursion. Dear Dr.
Hedge came out to make a morning visit. I kept him
as long as I could. We talked of Bartol, Rubinstein,
Father Taylor, and Margaret Fuller, whom he knew
when she was fourteen years old. He urged me to labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
for dress reform, which he considered much needed.
Had preached two sermons on the subject which his
dressy parishioners resented, telling him that their
husbands approved of their fine clothes. I begged him
to unearth these sermons and give them to us at the
club. We spoke of marriage, and I unfolded rapidly
my military and moral theory of human relations.
Thought of a text for a sermon on this subject: 'Arise,
take up thy bed and walk.' This because the ills of
marriage which are deemed incurable are not. We
must meet them with the energetic will which converts
evil into good, and without which all good degenerates
into evil."</p>


<p><br />July finds her at Oak Glen. She is full of texts and
sermons, but makes time to write to Fanny Perkins,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
proposing "<i>Picnics with a Purpose</i>, sketching, seaside
lectures, astronomical evenings." This thought may
have been the germ from which grew the Town and
Country Club, of which more hereafter.</p>

<p>The writing of sermons seems to have crowded serious
poetry out of sight in these days, but the Comic
Muse was always at hand with tambourine and flageolet,
ready to strike up at a moment's notice. There was
much coming and going of young men and maidens at
Oak Glen in those days, and much singing of popular
songs of a melancholy or desperate cast. The maiden
was requested to take back the heart she had given;
what was its anguish to her? There were handfuls of
earth in a coffin hid, a coffin under the daisies, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
beautiful, beautiful daisies; and so on, and so on, <i>ad
lachrymam</i>. She bore all this patiently; but one day
she said to Maud, "Come! You and these young persons
know nothing whatever of real trouble. I will
make you a song about a real trouble!" And she produced,
words and tune, the following ditty:&mdash;</p>

<p>COOKERY BOOKERY, OH!</p>

<p>
My Irish cook has gone away<br />
Upon my dinner-party day;<br />
I don't know what to do or say&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cookery bookery, oh!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Chorus</i>:</span><br />

Sing, coals are high and always higher!<br />
Sing, crossed and vexed, till you expire!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cookery bookery, oh!</span><br />
<br />
She could cook every kind of dish,<br />
"Wittles" of meat and "wittles" of fish,<br />
And soup as fancy as you wish&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And she is gone away!</span><br />
<br />
She weighed two hundred pounds of cheek,<br />
She had a voice that made me meek,<br />
I had to listen when she did speak&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cookery bookery, oh!</span><br />
<br />

And eyes the saucepan on the shelf;<br />
Says he, "Why don't you cook yourself?"<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span><i>Jocosa Lyra!</i> one chord of its gay music suggests
another. It may have been in this summer that she
wrote "The Newport Song," which also has its own
lilting melody.</p>

<p>
<i>Non sumus fashionabiles:<br />
Non damus dapes splendides:</i><br />
But in a modest way, you know,<br />
We like to see our money go:<br />
<i>Et gaudeamus igitur</i>,<br />
Our soul has nought to fidget her!<br />
<br />
We do not care to quadrigate<br />
On Avenues in gilded state:<br />
No gold-laced footmen laugh behind<br />
At our vacuity of mind:<br />
But in a modest one-horse shay,<br />
We rumble, tumble as we may,<br />
<i>Et gaudeamus igitur</i>,<br />
Our soul has nought to fidget her!<br />
<br />
When æstivation is at end,<br />
We've had our fun and seen our friend.<br />
No thought of payment makes us ill,<br />
We don't know such a word as "bill":<br />
<i>Et gaudeamus igitur</i>,<br />
Our soul has nought to fidget her!<br />
</p>

<p>She always tried to go at least once in the summer
to see the old people at the Town Farm, a pleasant,
gray old house, not far from Oak Glen.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon visited the poorhouse with J. and
F. and found several of the old people again, old Nancy
who used to make curious patchwork; old Benny, half-witted;
Elsteth, Henrietta, and Harriet, very glad to
see us. Julia read them a Psalm, then Harriet and
Elsteth sang an interminable Methodist hymn, and I
was moved to ask if they would like to have me pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
with them. They assented, and I can only say that
my heart was truly lifted up by the sense of the universality
of God's power and goodness, to which these
forlorn ones could appeal as directly as could the most
powerful, rich, or learned people."</p>

<p>Later she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The summer seems to me to have been rich in good
and in interest as I review it. Sweet, studious days,
pleasant intercourse with friends, the joy of preaching,
and very much in all this the well-being of my dear
family, children and grandchildren, their father and
grandfather enjoying them with me. This is much to
thank God for."</p>

<p>Some of the family lingered on after most of the
household <i>impedimenta</i> had been sent up to Boston,
and were caught napping.</p>

<p>"Sitting quietly with Chev over the fire after a game
of whist with Julia and Paddock,&mdash;a hack-driver
knocked at the door of our little back parlor, saying
that a gentleman was waiting at the front door for
admission. I opened the door and found Dr. Alex
Voickoff, who had learned in Boston of our being here
and had come down to stay over Sunday. The floors
of nearly every parlor and bedroom had been newly
oiled. We had no spare bedding. I spared what I could
from my ill-provided bed&mdash;we made the guest as
comfortable as we could. The bedding had been sent
up to Boston. <i>Hinc illæ lachrymæ.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>November 26.</i> Saw Salvini's 'Othello.' As wonderful
as people say it is. The large theatre [the Boston]
packed, and so quiet that you could have heard a pin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
drop. From the serene majesty of the opening scenes
to the agony of the end, all was grand and astounding
even to us to whom the play is familiar. The Italian
version seemed to me very fine, preserving all the literary
points of the original. In fact it seemed as if I had
always before heard the play through an English translation,
so much did the Italian speech and action light
it up."</p>

<p>She found Salvini's "Hamlet" "not so good for him
as 'Othello,' yet he was wonderful in it, and made a
very strong impression."</p>

<p>She met the great actor, and found his manners "cordial,
natural, and high-toned." She gave a dinner-party
for him, and found him to improve more and
more on further acquaintance. He became a valued
friend, always greeted with delight.</p>

<p>In December, 1873, Richard Ward, her last surviving
uncle, died. He had lived on at No. 8 Bond Street
after the death of Uncle John, and had kept up the
traditions of that hospitable house, always receiving
her most affectionately.</p>

<p>"<i>December 11.</i> Uncle Richard's funeral. A quiet one,
but on the whole satisfactory and almost pleasant, he
having lived out his life and dying surrounded by his
children and other relatives, and the family gathering
around his remains wearing an aspect of cordiality and
mutual good-will. I put a sprig of white daphne in the
folds of the marble drapery of dear father's bust and
kissed the bust, feeling that it had taken all of these
years to teach me his value and the value of the moral
and spiritual inheritance which I had from him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
could not wholly waste with all the follies which
checker the better intentions of my life. I went to
Greenwood and into the vault, and saw the sacred
names of the dear departed on the slabs which sealed
the deposit of their remains. It was all like a dream
and a sad one."</p>

<p>"<i>December 12.</i> No. 8 Bond Street. I came down here
to write the records of yesterday and to-day in this
dear old house, whose thronging memories rise up to
wring my heart, in the prospect of its speedy dismantlement
and the division of its dear contents. Here I
came on my return from Europe in 1844, bringing my
dear Julia, then an infant of six months. Uncle John
had just bought and fitted it up. Here I came to attend
Sister Louisa's wedding, Uncle John being rather distant
to me, supposing that I had favored the marriage.
Here I saw dear Brother Marion for the last time. Here
I came in my most faulty and unhappy period. Here,
after my first publications; here, to see my play acted
at Wallack's. Here, when death had taken my dearest
Sammy from me. Uncle John was so kind and merciful
at that time, and always except that once, when indeed
he did not express <i>dis</i>pleasure, but I partly guessed it
and learned it more fully afterwards. God's blessing
rest upon the memory of this hospitable and unstained
house. It seems to me as if neither words nor tears
could express the pain I feel in closing this account
with my father's generation."</p>


<p><br />The most important episode of 1874, the visit to
Samana, has already been described. Turning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
leaves of the Journal for this year, we feel that the
change and break were necessary to her as well as to
the Doctor. There were limits even to her strength.</p>

<p>"<i>January, 1874.</i> A sort of melancholy of confusion,
not knowing how I can possibly get through with the
various requisitions made upon my time, strength,
thought, and sympathy. Usually I feel, even in these
moods, the nearness of divine help. To-day it seems
out of my consciousness, but is not on that account
out of my belief...."</p>

<p>"The past week one dreadful hurry. Things look
colorless when you whirl so fast past them."</p>

<p>"The month ending to-day seems the most hurried
of my life. Woman's Club, Saturday Club, Philosophical
group, Maud's music, ditto party, and all her
dressing and gayety, beside writing for [the Woman's]
Journal, ... two lectures [Salem and Weston], both
gratuitous, and the care of getting up and advertising
Bishop Ferrette's lectures. And in all these things I
seem not to do, rather than to do, the dissipation of
effort so calls me away from the quiet, concentrated
sort of work which I love."</p>

<p>It was time for the Doctor to say "Come!" and
to carry her off to those tropical solitudes they had
learned to love so well. Yet the departure was painful,
for Maud must be left behind. On March 1 we read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of to-day I wish to preserve the fact that, waking
early in painful perplexity about Maud, Santo
Domingo, etc., and praying that the right way might
open for me and for all of us, my prayer seemed answered
by the very great comfort I had in hearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
prayer and sermon of Henry Powers of New York.
The decided spiritual tone of the prayer made me feel
that I must try to take, every day, this energetic attitude
of moral will and purpose, even if I fail in much
that I wish to do."</p>

<p>On May 27 she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My birthday. Fifty-five years old. Still face to
face with the mercies of God in health and sanity, enjoying
all true pleasures more than ever and weaned
from some false ones. I feel a great lassitude, probably
from my cold and yesterday's fatigue. I have not
worked this year as I did the year before, yet I have
worked a good deal, too, and perhaps have tried more
to fulfil the duty nearest at hand.... I thank God for
my continued life, health, and comfort.... I ask to see
Samana free before I go.... 'Thy will be done' is the
true prayer."</p>

<p>Samana was not to be free, spite of the efforts of its
friends, and she was not to see it again.</p>

<p>The record of this year and the next is a chronicle of
arduous work, with the added and ever-deepening note
of anxiety; it was only for a time that the visit to
Samana checked the progress of the Doctor's physical
failure. He was able in the summer of 1874 to write
the forty-third report of the Perkins Institution: an
important one in which he reviewed his whole work
among the blind. He felt that this would probably
be his last earthly task; yet the following summer
found him again taking up the familiar work, laboring
with what little strength was left him, and when eyes
and hand refused to answer the call of the spirit, dictating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
to his faithful secretary. It has been told elsewhere
how in this last summer of his life he labored
to make more beautiful and more valuable the summer
home which had become very dear to him.</p>

<p>Returned to Green Peace, he had some happy days
in his garden, but for gardener and garden they were
the last days. The city had decided to put a street
through Green Peace: already workmen were digging
trenches and cutting trees. Our mother went to the authorities,
and told them of his feeble condition. The
work was stopped at once, and not resumed during
his lifetime.</p>

<p>Through these years her time was divided between
the invalid and the many public duties which had
already taken possession of her life. Little by little
these were crowded out: instead of lecture or concert
came the ever-shortening walk with the Doctor, the
evening game of whist or backgammon which lightened
a little his burden of pain and weariness.</p>

<p>Yet she was preparing, on January 4, 1876, to keep
a lecture engagement of long standing, when the blow
fell. He was stricken down, and lay for some days
insensible, waiting the final summons.</p>

<p>There was no hope of his recovery: those around him
waited patiently, any violence of grief held in check by
the silent rebuke of the serene face on the pillow.</p>

<p>The day after his death she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I awoke at 4.30, but lay still to bear the chastening
hand of God, laid upon me in severe mercy....</p>

<p>"Some good words came to me: 'Let not your heart
be troubled,' etc. 'He doth not willingly afflict,' etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>"Before breakfast went into Chev's room, so sweet
and peaceful.... I laid my lace veil, my bridal veil,
upon the head of his bedstead.... In place of my dear
husband I have now my foolish papers. Yet I have
often left him for them. God accept the poor endeavor
of my life!"</p>

<p>On the day after the funeral she writes: "Began my
new life to-day. Prayed God that it might have a
greatly added use and earnestness."</p>

<p>And several weeks later, after the memorial meeting
in his honor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yesterday seems to have filled the measure of the
past. To-day I must forward in the paths of the future.
My dear love is sometimes with me, at least as an energizing
and inspiring influence, but how shall I deserve
ever to see him again?"</p>

<p>The paths of the future! She was to tread them with
cheerful and willing feet through many long years,
never wholly losing the sense of companionship with
her good comrade.</p>

<p>She devoted the spring of 1876 to the writing of a
brief memoir of him, which was printed in pamphlet
form and in raised type for the use of the blind. With
the latter object in view the memoir was necessarily
brief. The labor of condensing into a small space the
record of a long and super-active life was severe, but it
was the tonic she needed. The days of quiet at Green
Peace, the arduous work, with a page of Greek or
a chapter of Baur for relaxation, brought mind and
nerves back to their normal condition.</p>

<p>The work speaks for itself. As it is little known to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
outside the schools for the blind, we quote the
concluding paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In what is said, to-day, concerning the motherhood
of the human race, the social and spiritual aspects of
this great office are not wholly overlooked. It must be
remembered that there is also a fatherhood of human
society, a vigilance and forethought of benevolence
recognized in the individuals who devote their best
energies to the interests of mankind. The man to
whose memory the preceding pages are dedicated is
one of those who have best filled this relation to their
race. Watchful of its necessities, merciful to its shortcomings,
careful of its dignity, and cognizant of its
capacity, may the results of his labor be handed down
to future generations, and may his name and example
be held in loving and lasting remembrance."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE WOMAN'S CAUSE</h3>

<h4>1868-1910</h4>

<p>
Women who weave in hope the daily web,<br />
Who leave the deadly depths of passion pure,<br />
Who hold the stormy powers of will attent,<br />
As Heaven directs, to act, or to endure;<br />
<br />
No multitude strews branches in their way,<br />
Not in their praise the loud arena strives;<br />
Still as a flameless incense rises up<br />
The costly patience of their offered lives.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">J. W. H.</span><br />
</p>


<p><br />We have seen that after the Doctor's death our
mother felt that another chapter of life had begun for
her. It was a changed world without that great and
dominant personality. She missed the strength on
which she had leaned for so many years, the weakness
which through the past months she had tended and
cherished. Henceforth she must lead, not follow;
must be captain instead of mate.</p>

<p>In another sense, the new life had actually begun
for her some years before, when she first took up public
activities; to those activities she now turned the
more ardently for the great void that was left in heart
and home. We must now go back to the later sixties,
and speak of her special interests at that time.</p>

<p>Looking back over her long life, we see her in three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
aspects, those of the student, the artist, the reformer.
First came youth, with its ardent study; then maturity,
with its output of poems, plays, essays. So far she had
followed the natural course of creative minds, which
must absorb and assimilate in order that they may
give out. It is in the third phase that we find the
aspect of her later life, a clear vision of the needs of
humanity, and a profound hospitality which made it
imperative for her to give with both hands not only
what she had inherited, but what she had earned.
Having enjoyed unusual advantages herself, the moment
she saw the way to give other women these
advantages, she was eager to "help the woman-standard
new unfurled."</p>

<p>In the first number of the "Woman's Journal," of
which she was one of the founders and first editors, she
writes (January 8, 1870):&mdash;</p>

<p>"We who stand beside the cradle of this enterprise
are not young in years. Our children are speedily preparing
to take our place in the ranks of society. Some
of us have been looking thoughtfully toward the final
summons, not because of ill health or infirmity, but
because, after the establishment of our families, no
great object intervened between ourselves and that
last consummation. But these young undertakings
detain us in life. While they need so much care and
counsel, we cannot consent to death. And this first
year, at least, of our Journal, we are determined to live
through."</p>

<p>Again she writes of this new departure:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In an unexpected hour a new light came to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
showing me a world of thought and character. The
new domain was that of true womanhood, woman no
longer in her ancillary relation to man, but in direct
relation to the divine plan and purpose, as a free agent
fully sharing with man every human right and every
human responsibility. This discovery was like the addition
of a new continent to the map of the world. It
did not come all at once. In my philosophizing I at
length reached the conclusion that woman must be
the moral and spiritual equivalent of man. How otherwise
could she be entrusted with the awful and inevitable
responsibilities of maternity? The Civil War
came to an end, leaving the slave not only emancipated
but endowed with the full dignity of citizenship.
The women of the North had greatly helped to open
the door which admitted him to freedom and its safeguard,
the ballot. Was the door to be shut in their
face?"</p>

<p>When this new world of thought, this new continent
of sympathy was opened to her, she was nearly fifty
years old. "Oh! had I earlier known," she exclaims,
"the power, the nobility, the intelligence which lie
within the range of true womanhood, I had surely
lived more wisely and to better purpose."</p>

<p>Speaking of this new interest in her life, her old
friend Tom Appleton (who had not the least sympathy
with it) once said, "Your mother's great importance to
this cause is that she forms a bridge between the world
of society and the world of reform."</p>

<p>She soon found that she was not alone in her questioning;
similar thoughts to hers were germinating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
in the minds of many women. In our own and other
countries a host of earnest souls were awake, pressing
eagerly forward. In quick succession came the
women's clubs and colleges, the renewed demand for
woman suffrage, the Association for the Advancement
of Women, the banding together of women ministers.
The hour had come, and the women. In all these varying
manifestations of one great forward and upward
movement in America, Julia Ward Howe was <i>pars
magna</i>. Indeed, the story of the latter half of her life
is the story of the Advance of Woman and the part
she played in it.</p>

<p>The various phases may be taken in order. Oberlin,
the first coeducational college, was chartered in 1834.
Vassar, the first college for women only, was chartered
in 1861, opened in 1865. Smith and Wellesley followed
in 1875. Considering this brave showing, it is
strange to recall the great fight before the barred doors
of the great universities. The women knocked, gently
at first, then strongly: our mother, Mrs. Agassiz, and
the rest. They were greeted by a storm of protest.
Learned books were written, brilliant lectures delivered,
to prove that a college education was ruinous to
the health of women, perilous to that of future generations.
The friends of Higher Education replied in
words no less ardent. Blast and counterblast rang
forth. Still the patient hands knocked, the earnest
voices called: till at length&mdash;there being friends as
well as foes inside&mdash;slowly, with much creaking and
many forebodings, the great doors opened; a crack,
then a space, till to-day they swing wide, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
Higher Education of Women now stands firm as the
Pyramids.</p>

<p>The idea of woman suffrage had long been repugnant
to our mother. The demand for it seemed
unreasonable; she was inclined to laugh both at the
cause and its advocates; yet when, in November, 1868,
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson asked her to
give her name to a call for a meeting in behalf of
woman suffrage she did not refuse. It would be "a
liberal and friendly meeting," the Colonel said, "without
bitterness or extravagance."</p>

<p>On the day of the meeting she "strayed into Horticultural
Hall" in her "rainy-day suit, with no idea of
taking any active part in the proceedings." Indeed,
she had hoped to remain unnoticed, until summoned
by an urgent message to join those who sat upon the
platform; reluctantly she obeyed the summons. With
this simple action the old order changed for her. On
the platform were gathered the woman suffrage leaders,
some of whom she already knew: William Lloyd Garrison,
Wendell Phillips, Thomas Wentworth Higginson,
James Freeman Clarke; veteran captains of Reform,
her husband's old companions-in-arms. Looking in
their steadfast faces, she felt that she belonged with
them; that she must help to draw the car of progress,
not drag like a brake on its wheel.</p>

<p>Beside these were some unknown to her. She saw
now for the first time the sweet face of Lucy Stone,
heard the silver voice which was to be dear to her
through many years. "Here stood the true woman,
pure, noble, great-hearted, with the light of her good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
life shining in every feature of her face." These men
and women had been the champions of the slave.
They now asked for wives and mothers those civil
rights which had been given to the negro; "that impartial
justice for which, if for anything, a Republican
Government should stand." Their speech was earnest;
she listened as to a new gospel. When she was
asked to speak, she could only say, "I am with you."</p>

<p>With the new vision came the call of a new duty.
"What can I do?" she asked. The answer was ready.
The New England Woman Suffrage Association was
formed, and she was elected its first president. This
office she held, with some interruptions, through life.
It is well to recall the patient, faithful work of the
pioneer suffragists, who, without money or prestige,
spent <i>themselves</i> for the cause. Their efforts, compared
to the well-organized and well-financed campaigns of
to-day, are as a "certain upper chamber" compared
with the basilica of St. Peter, yet it was in that quiet
room that the tongues of Pentecost spoke.</p>

<p>"I am glad," she often said, "to have joined the
suffrage movement, because it has brought me into
such high company."</p>

<p>The convert buckled to her new task with all her
might, working for it early and late with an ardor that
counted no cost.</p>

<p>"Oh! dear Mrs. Howe, you are so <i>full</i> of inspiration!"
cried a foolish woman. "It enables you to do <i>so
much</i>!"</p>

<p>"Inspiration!" said "dear Mrs. Howe," shortly.
"Inspiration means <i>perspiration</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>She says of her early work for suffrage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One of the comforts which I found in the new association
was the relief which it afforded me from a
sense of isolation and eccentricity. For years past I
had felt strongly impelled to lend my voice to the convictions
of my heart. I had done this in a way, from
time to time, always with the feeling that my course
in doing so was held to call for apology and explanation
by the men and women with whose opinions I had
hitherto been familiar. I now found a sphere of action
in which this mode of expression no longer appeared
singular or eccentric, but simple, natural, and, under
the circumstances, inevitable."</p>

<p>It was no small thing for her to take up this burden.
The Doctor, although a believer in equal suffrage, was
strongly opposed to her taking any active part in public
life. He felt as Grandfather Howe had felt forty
years before when his son Sam spoke in public for the
sake of Greece; it jarred on his traditions. Others of
the family also deplored the new departure, and her
personal friends almost with one accord held up hands
of horror or deprecation. These things were inexpressibly
painful to her; she loved approbation; the society
and sympathy of "kent folk," whose traditions corresponded
with her own; but her hand was on the
plough; there was no turning back.</p>

<p>Suffrage worked her hard. The following year the
New England Woman Suffrage Association issued a
call for the formation of a national body; the names
signed were Lucy Stone, Caroline M. Severance, Julia
Ward Howe, T. W. Higginson, and G. H. Vibbert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Representatives from twenty-one States assembled
in Cleveland, November 24, 1869, and formed the
American Woman Suffrage Association. There was
already a "National Woman Suffrage Association,"
formed a few months earlier; the new organization
differed from the other in some points of policy, notably
in the fact that men as well as women were
recognized among the leaders. Colonel Higginson
was its president at one time, Henry Ward Beecher,
Bishop Gilbert Haven, and Dudley Foulke at others.
The New England Woman's Club also admitted men
to membership: it was a point our mother had much at
heart. She held that the Quaker organization was the
best, with its separate meetings of men and women,
supplemented by a joint session of both. She always
insisted upon the salutary influence that men and
women exercise upon one another.</p>

<p>"The two sexes police each other," she often said.
She always maintained the importance of their united
action in matters of public as of private interest. She
was essentially a humanist in contradistinction to a
feminist.</p>

<p>She worked for the American Association during
the twenty-one years of its separate existence, first
as foreign corresponding secretary, afterward as president,
and in various other capacities. When, in 1890,
the two societies united to form the National American
Woman Suffrage Association, she became and continued
through life one of the vice-presidents of that
body. From the first, she was recognized as an invaluable
leader. The years of philosophical study had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
made her mind supple, alert, quick to grasp and to
respond, even as the study of languages brought her
the gift of ready speech and pure diction. Her long
practice in singing had given her voice strength, sweetness,
and carrying power; above all, she was a natural
orator, and speaking was a joy to her. The first time
she ever made a speech in public was to a group of
soldiers of the Army of the Potomac on the occasion of
a visit to Washington during the war. She had driven
out to visit the camp outside the Capital. Colonel
William B. Greene disconcerted her very much by
saying, "Mrs. Howe, you must speak to my men."</p>

<p>She refused, and ran away to hide in an adjacent
tent. The Colonel insisted, and finally she managed
to make a very creditable little speech to the soldiers.</p>

<p>Now, she no longer ran away when called upon to
speak. Wherever the work called her, she went gladly;
like St. Paul, she was "in journeyings often, ... in
weariness and painfulness, in watchings often"; the
journals are full of incidents picturesque to read, uncomfortable
to live through. Occasionally, after some
tremendous exertion, we read, "Maud must not know
of this!" or, "No one must ever know that I took the
wrong train!"</p>

<p>Much of her most important work for woman suffrage
was done at the State House, Boston. In Massachusetts,
the custom of bringing this subject before
the legislature every year long prevailed. She always
went to these hearings. She considered it a privilege
to take part in them; counted them "among her most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
valued recollections." They extended over forty years
or more.</p>

<p>These occasions were often exasperating as well as
fatiguing. She never wearied of presenting the arguments
for suffrage; she often suffered vexation of spirit
in refuting those brought against it, but she never
refused the battle. "If I were mad enough," she said
once, "I could speak in Hebrew!"</p>

<p>She was "mad enough" when at a certain hearing
woman suffrage was condemned as a "minority
cause." Her words, if not in Hebrew, show the fighting
spirit of ancient Israel.</p>

<p>We quote from memory:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Reverend &mdash;&mdash;: "The fact that most women
are indifferent or opposed is a sufficient proof that
woman suffrage is wrong."</p>

<p>Mrs. Howe: "May I ask one question? Were the
Twelve Apostles wrong in trying to bring about a
better social condition when almost the whole community
was opposed to them?"</p>

<p>Dr. &mdash;&mdash;: "I suppose that question was asked
merely for rhetorical effect."</p>

<p>Mrs. Howe (having asked for two minutes to reply,
with the whispered comment, "<i>I shall die</i> if I am not
allowed to speak!"): "I do not know how it is with
Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, but I was not brought up to use the Bible
for rhetorical effect. To my mind, the suffragists and
their opponents are like the wise and the foolish virgins
of the parable, equal in number but not in wisdom.
When the Bridegroom cometh, may Dr. &mdash;&mdash; have
his wedding garment ready!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>She thus recalls some of the scenes in the State
House where she was so long a familiar figure:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have again and again been one of a deputation
charged with laying before a legislature the injustice
of the law which forbids the husband a business contract
with his wife, and of that which denies to a married
woman the right to be appointed guardian of her
children. We reasoned also against what in legal language
is termed 'the widow's quarantine,' the ordinance
which forbids a widow to remain in her husband's
house more than forty days without paying
rent, the widower in such case possessing an unlimited
right to abide under the roof of his deceased wife.
Finally, we dared ask that night-walkers of the male
sex should be made liable to the same penalties as
women for the same offence. Our bill passed the legislature,
and became part of the laws of Massachusetts."</p>

<p>Elsewhere she writes: "In Massachusetts the
suffragists worked for fifty-five years before they
succeeded in getting a law making mothers equal
guardians of their minor children with the fathers. In
Colorado, when the women were enfranchised, the
next legislature passed such a bill." Of the movement
by which women won a right to have a voice in the
education of their children, she says: "The proposal
to render women eligible for service on the School
Board was met at first with derision and with serious
disapproval. The late Abby W. May had much to do
with the early consideration of this measure, and the
work which finally resulted in its adoption had its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
first beginning in the parlors of the New England
Woman's Club, where special meetings were held in
its behalf. The extension of the school suffrage to
women followed, after much work on the part of men
and of women."</p>

<p>"These meetings," she said once, speaking before
the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association,
"show, among other things, the character of those who
believe in suffrage with their whole heart. We who are
gathered here are not a frantic, shrieking mob. We
are not contemners of marriage, nor neglecters of home
and offspring. We are individually allowed to be men
and women of sound intellect, of reputable life, having
the same stake and interest in the well-being of the
community that others have. Most of us are persons
of moderate competence, earned or inherited. We
have had, or hope to have, our holy fireside, our joyful
cradle, our decent bank account. Why should any
consider us as the enemies of society, we who have
everything to gain by its good government?"</p>

<p>It seems fitting to add a few more of her words in
behalf of the cause which she served so long,&mdash;words
spoken at Club meetings, at Conventions before Legislatures.</p>

<p>"But besides the philosophy of woman suffrage, we
want its religion. Human questions are not glorified
until they are brought into touch with the Divine...."</p>

<p>"The weapon of Christian warfare is the ballot,
which represents the peaceable assertion of conviction
and will. Adopt it, O you women, with clean hands
and a pure heart!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"The religion which makes me a moral agent equally
with my father and brother, gives me my right and
title to the citizenship which I am here to assert. I
ought to share equally with them its privileges and
its duties. No man can have more at stake in the community
than I have. Imposition of taxes, laws concerning
public health, order, and morality, affect me
precisely as they affect the male members of my
family, and I am bound equally with them to look to
the maintenance of a worthy and proper standard and
status in all of these departments."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"God forbid that in this country chivalry and legislation
should be set one against the other. I ask you,
gentlemen, to put your chivalry into your legislation.
Let the true Christian knighthood find its stronghold
in your ranks. Arm yourselves with the best reasons,
with the highest resolve, and deliver us poor women from
the injustice which oppresses and defrauds us."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Revere the religion of home. Keep its altar flame
bright in your heart.... The vestals of ancient Rome
were at once guardians of the hearth and custodians
of the archives of the Roman State. So, in every time,
the home conserves the sacred flame of life, and the
destiny of the nation rests with those who keep it."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Go abroad with the majesty and dignity of your
home about you.... Let the modest graces of the
fireside adorn you in the great gathering. This is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
new sort of home missionary, one who shall carry the
blessed spirit of home wherever she goes, a spirit of
rest, of healing, of reconciliation and good-will."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"One aspect of this [the military argument] would
make the protection which men are supposed to give
to women in time of war the equivalent for the political
rights denied them. But, gentlemen, let me ask what
protection can you give us which shall compare with
the protection we give you when you are born, little
helpless creatures, into the world, without feet to stand
upon, or hands to help yourselves? Without this tender,
this unceasing protection, no man of you would live
to grow up. It may easily happen that no man of a
whole generation shall ever be called upon to defend
the women of his country in the field. But it cannot
happen that the women of any generation shall fail
to give their unwearied and energetic protection to the
infant men born of it. Some of us know how full of
labor and detail this protection is; what anxious days,
what sleepless nights it involves. The mothers are
busy at home, not only building up the bodies of the
little men, but building up their minds too, teaching
them to be gentle, pure and honest, cultivating the
elements of the human will, that great moralizing
power on which the State and the Church depend. A
man is very happy if he can ever repay to his mother
the protection she gave him in his infancy. So, the
plea of protection has two sides.</p>

<p>"If manhood suffrage is unsatisfactory, it does not
at all show that woman suffrage would be. On the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
we might make it much better by bringing to it
the feminine mind, which, in a way, complements the
masculine, and so, I think, completes the mind of
humanity. We are half of humanity, and I do frankly
believe that we have half the intelligence and good
sense of humanity, and that it is quite time that we
should express not only our sentiments but our determined
will, to set our faces as a flint toward justice
and right, and to follow these through the difficult
path, through the thorny wilderness. Not to the bitter
end, but a very sweet end, and I hope it may be
before my end comes."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Her last service to the cause of woman suffrage was
to send a circular letter to all the editors and to all the
ministers of four leading denominations in the four
oldest suffrage States, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and
Idaho, asking whether equal suffrage worked well or
ill. She received 624 answers, 62 not favorable, 46 in
doubt, and 516 in favor. A letter from her to the London
"Times," stating these results, appeared on the
same day that the news of her death was cabled to
Europe.</p>

<p>Thinking of the long years of effort which followed
her adoption of the cause of woman suffrage, a word
of the Doctor's, spoken in 1875, comes vividly to mind.</p>

<p>"Your cause," said he, "lacks one element of success,
and that is opposition. It is so distinctly just
that it will slide into popularity." He little thought
that the cause was to wait forty years for that
slide!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>Side by side with the suffrage movement, growing
along with it and with the women's clubs, and in time
to be absorbed by them, was another movement which
was for many years very dear to her, the Association
for the Advancement of Women.</p>

<p>This Association had its beginning in 1873, when
Sorosis, then a sturdy infant, growing fast and reaching
out in every direction, issued a call for a Congress of
Women in New York in the autumn of that year. She
says of this call:&mdash;-</p>

<p>"Many names, some known, others unknown to me,
were appended to the document first sent forth. My
own was asked for. Should I give or withhold it?
Among the signatures already obtained, I saw that of
Maria Mitchell,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and this determined me to give my
own."</p>

<p>She went to the Congress, and "viewed its proceedings
a little critically at first," its plan appearing to
her "rather vast and vague."</p>

<p>Yet she felt the idea of the Association to be a good
one; and when it was formed, with the above title,
and with Mrs. Livermore as president, she was glad
to serve on a sub-committee, charged with selecting
topics and speakers for the first annual Congress.</p>

<p>The object of the Association was "to consider
and present practical methods for securing to women
higher intellectual, moral, and physical conditions,
with a view to the improvement of all domestic and
social relations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>At its first Congress she said:</p>

<p>"How can women best associate their efforts for the
amelioration of Society? We must come together in a
teachable and religious spirit. Women, while building
firmly and definitely the fabric they decide to rear,
must yet build with an individual tolerance which their
combined and corporate wisdom may better explain.
The form of the Association should be representative,
in a true and wide sense. Deliberation in common,
mutual instruction, achievement for the whole better
and more valuable than the success of any,&mdash;these
should be the objects held constantly in view. The
good of all the aim of each. The discipline of labor,
faith, and sacrifice is necessary. Our growth in harmony
of will and in earnestness of purpose will be far
more important than in numbers."</p>

<p>One hundred and ninety women formed this Association:
a year later there were three hundred. The second
Congress was held in Chicago, with an attendance
"very respectable in numbers and character from the
first, and very full in afternoon and evening."</p>

<p>On the second day, October 16, 1874, the subject
considered was "Crime and Reform." The Journal
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ellen Mitchell's paper on fallen women was
first-rate throughout. I spoke first after it, saying
that we must carry the war into Africa and reform the
men...."</p>

<p>The meetings of the Congress grew more and more
important to her. That of 1875 found her "much
tossed in mind" about going, on account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Doctor's ill health. She consulted Mr. Clarke, but
felt afterward that this was a mistake.</p>

<p>"My dæmon says: 'Go and say nothing. Nobody
can help you bear your own child.'"</p>

<p>She went.</p>

<p>No matter how fatiguing these journeys were, she
never failed to find some enjoyment in them; many
were the pleasant "fruits of friendship" gathered
along the way. Some one of the sisters was sure to
have a tiny teapot in her basket; another would produce
a spirit-lamp; they drank their tea, shared their
sandwiches, and were merry. She loved to travel with
her "dear big Livermore," with Lucy Stone, and the
faithful Blackwells, father and daughter; perhaps her
best-loved companion was Ednah Cheney, her "esteemed
friend of many years, excellent in counsel and
constant and loyal in regard."</p>

<p>Once she and Mrs. Cheney appeared together at an
"A.A.W." meeting in a Southern city, where speaking
and singing were to alternate on the programme.
It was in their later years: both were silver-haired
and white-capped. Our mother was to announce the
successive numbers. Glancing over the programme,
she saw that Mr. So-and-So was to sing "The Two
Grenadiers." With a twinkling glance toward Mrs.
Cheney, she announced, "The next number will be
'The Two Granny Dears'!"</p>

<p>The Reverend Antoinette Blackwell, describing one
of these journeys, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As we went onward I was ready to close my eyes
and 'loll' or look lazily out to see the flying landscape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
seem to be doing the work. When I roused enough to
look at Mrs. Howe she was reading. Later, I looked
again, she was still reading. This went on mile after
mile till I was enough interested to step quietly across
the aisle and peep over Mrs. Howe's shoulder without
disturbing her. She was reading a Greek volume,
apparently with as much enjoyment as most of us gain
from reading in plain English when we are not tired....
With apparent unwearied enjoyment, she told us
anecdotes, repeated the little stories and rhymes and
sang the little songs which she had given to her children
and grandchildren....</p>

<p>"We lingered at the breakfast table in the morning
and among other things came to comparing social likes
and dislikes. 'I never can bring myself to destroy the
least bit of paper,' said Mrs. Howe, meaning paper
written on, containing the record of human thought
and feeling which might be of worth, and its only record.
To her these were the chief values of life."</p>

<p>The following notes are taken from the record
of "A.A.W." journeys in the eighties:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Buffalo, October 22, 1881.</i> I felt quite distracted
about leaving home when I came this way for the
Congress, but have felt clear about the good of it, ever
since. I rarely have much religious meditation in
these days, except to be very sorry for a very faulty
life. I will therefore record the fact that I have felt
an unusual degree of religious comfort in these last
days. It seemed a severe undertaking to preach to-day
after so busy a week, and with little or no time for
preparation. But my text came to me as it usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
does, and a hope that the sermon would be given to
me, which, indeed, it seemed to be. I thought it out in
bed last night and this morning...."</p>

<p>
"My beautiful, beautiful West,<br />
I clasp thee to my breast!<br />
Or rather down I lie,<br />
Like a little old babe and cry,<br />
A babe to second childhood born,<br />
Astonished at the mighty morn,<br />
And only pleading to be fed,<br />
From Earth's illimitable bread!"<br />
</p>

<p>"Left Schenectady yesterday. Drawing-room car.
Read Greek a good deal. At Syracuse I took the
tumbler of the car and ran out to get some milk, etc.,
for supper. Spent 25 cents, and took my slender meal
in the car, on a table. After this, slept profoundly all
the evening; took the sleeper at Rochester, and slept
like the dead, having had very insufficient sleep for
two nights past. Was awakened early to get out at
Cleveland&mdash;much detained by a young woman who
got into the dressing-room before me, and stayed to
make an elaborate toilet, keeping every one else out.
When at last she came out, I said to her, 'Well,
madam, you have taken your own time, to the inconvenience
of everybody else. You are the most selfish
woman I ever travelled with.' Could get only a cup
of coffee and a roll at Cleveland&mdash;much confusion
about cars&mdash;regained mine, started, and found that
I had left my trunk at Cleveland, unchecked. Flew to
conductor, who immediately took measures to have it
forwarded. Must wait all day at Shelby, in the most
forlorn hole I ever saw called a hotel. No parlor, a
dark bedroom for me to stay in, a cold hell without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
fire, and a very hot one with it. Dirty bed not made
up, a sinister likeness of Schuyler Colfax hanging high
on the wall, and a print of the managers of Andy Johnson's
impeachment. I&mdash;in distress about my trunk&mdash;have
telegraphed to Mansfield for the title of my
lecture and learn that it is 'Polite Society.' Must give
it without the manuscript, and must borrow a gown to
give it in."</p>


<p class="center">"<i>Minnesota in Winter</i></p>

<p>"The twistings and turnings of a lecture trip have
brought me twice, in the present season, to Minnesota....</p>

<p>"To an Easterner, a daily walk or two is the first
condition of health. Here, the frost seemed to enter
one's very bones, and to make locomotion difficult....
Life at the hotel was mostly an anxious <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with an air-tight stove. Sometimes you roasted before
it, sometimes you froze. As you crammed it with wood
at night, you said, 'Will you, oh! will you burn till
morning?' Finally, on the coldest night of all, and at
that night's noon, you bade it farewell, on your way to
the midnight train, and wondered whether you should
be likely to go further and fare worse....</p>

<p>"After the lecture an informal sitting was held in
the parlor of my hostess, at which there was much talk
of the clubs of Boston; 'If I forget thee, O Jerusalem!'
being the predominant tone in the minds of those present.
And at noon, away, away, in the caboose of a
freight car, to meet the passenger train at Owatonna,
and so reach Minneapolis by early evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>"To travel in such a caboose is a somewhat rough
experience. The dirt is grimy and of long standing.
The pictures nailed up on the boards are not of an
edifying description. The railroad employees who have
admitted us into their place of refuge wear dirty overalls,
and eat their dinner out of tin pails all afloat with
hot coffee. One of my own sex keeps me in countenance....</p>


<p class="center">"<i>Minneapolis</i></p>

<p>"Twenty years ago, a small collection of wooden
houses, of no particular account, except for the natural
beauties of the spot on which they stood. Now, a
thriving and well-built city, whose manufacturers have
settled the controversy between use and beauty, by
appropriating the Falls of St. Anthony to the running
of their saw- and flour-mills. My first sensation of delight
here was at finding myself standing on Hennepin
Avenue. To a reader of Parkman's histories, the spot
was classic.... To refresh my own recollections, I had
recourse to the Public Library of the town, where I
soon found Parkman's 'Discovery of the Great West.'
Armed with this volume, with the aid of a cheap and
miserable railroad map, I traced out something of the
movements of those hardy French explorers. It was
like living part of a romance, to look upon the skies
and waters which had seen them wandering, suffering,
yet undaunted....</p>


<p class="center">"<i>St. Paul</i></p>

<p>"But I cannot rest so near St. Paul without visiting
this famous city also. I contemplate a trip in the cars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
but my friendly host leaves his business for a day, and
drives me over in an open sleigh. I do not undertake
this jaunt without Bostonian fears of death of cold,
but Minnesota cold is highly stimulating, and with the
aid of a bottle of hot water, I make the journey without
a shiver.... Numbers of Indian squaws from
Mendota walk the streets in groups. I follow three of
them into a warehouse. One of them has Asiatic features&mdash;the
others are rather pretty. They are Sioux.
I speak to them, but they do not reply. The owner of
the warehouse asks what he can show me. I tell him
that I desire to see what the squaws will buy. He says
that they buy very little, except beads, and have only
come into the store to warm themselves. They smile,
and obviously understand English. We dine at the
hotel, a very pleasant one. There is no printed bill of
fare, but the waiter calls off 'beefsteak, porksteak,'
etc., and we make a comfortable meal. I desire to
purchase some dried buffalo meat, and find some, not
without difficulty, as the season for selling it is nearly
over. The crowning romance of the day is a sleighride
of five miles on the Mississippi, giving us a near view
of its fluted bluffs and numerous islets. We visit also
the Falls of Minnehaha, now sheeted in ice, but very
beautiful, even in this disguise. We talk of 'Hiawatha,'
and my companion says, 'If Mr. Longfellow
had ever seen a Sioux Indian, he would not have
written "Hiawatha."' The way to the bottom of the
falls is so slippery with ice that I conclude not to attempt
it. The day, which was one of great exposure,
passed in great pleasure, and without chill or fatigue....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>"In my days of romance, I remember watching
late one night on board the Mediterranean steamer in
order to be sure of the moment in which we should pass
beyond the boundaries of the Italian shore. Something
like such a feeling of interest and regret came
over me when, in the unpoetic <i>sleeper</i>, I asked at what
hour of the night the cars would pass out of Minnesota
on the way back to Chicago. This sincere testimony
from a veteran of travel, in all sorts, will perhaps convince
those who do not know the young State that she
has a great charm of beauty and of climate, besides a
great promise of future prosperity and eminence."</p>


<p class="center">"<i>Kansas</i></p>

<p>"Travel in Minnesota was living romance. Travel
in Kansas is living history. I could not cross its
borders, new as these are, without unlocking a volume
of the past, written in blood and in prayer, and sealed
with the forfeit of noble lives. A ghostly army of warriors
seemed to escort me as I entered the fair, broad
territory. John Brown, the captain of them, stretched
his hand to the Capitol, and Sumner, and Andrew, and
Howe were with him. Here was the stand made, here
the good fight begun, which, before it was well under
way, divided the thought and sentiment of Europe, as
well as those of America.</p>

<p>"My tired spirit sought to shake off at this point the
commonplace sense of weariness and annoyance. To
be in Kansas, and that for work, not for pastime. To
bring the woman's word where the man's rough sword
and spade had once wrought together, this was poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
not prose. To be cold, and hungry, and worn with
journeying, could not efface the great interest and
pleasure....</p>


<p class="center">"<i>Atchison</i></p>

<p>"I was soon told that a gentleman was anxious to
speak with me concerning my land at Grasshopper,
which borders immediately upon his own. Judge Van
Winkle accordingly, with due permission, waited upon
me, and unfolded his errand. Grasshopper, he said,
was a growing place. It possessed already a store and
an apothecary. It had now occasion for a schoolhouse,
and one corner of my land offered the most convenient
place for such an institution. The town did not ask me
to give this land&mdash;it was willing to pay a fair price
for the two acres wanted. Wishing to learn a little
more about the township, I asked whether it possessed
the requisite variety of creeds.</p>

<p>"'Have you a Baptist, a Methodist, an Episcopalian,
and a Universalist church?'</p>

<p>"'No,' said my visitor, 'we have no church at all.
People who wish to preach can do so in some private
house.' I afterwards learn that Judge Van Winkle is
a student of Plato; who knows what may be his Hellenic
heresy? He is endorsed, however, by others as a
good, solid man, and the proposition for the schoolhouse
receives my favorable consideration.</p>


<p class="center">"<i>Leavenworth</i></p>

<p>"My first visit to Leavenworth was a stay of a couple
of hours between trains, on my way to southern Kansas.
Short as this was, it yet brought to my acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
two new friends, and to my remembrance two
old ones. Of the new friends, the first seen was Rev.
Edward Sanborn, the Unitarian minister of the place.
Mr. Sanborn met me at the comfortless depot, and
insisted upon taking me to his lodgings, where Friend
Number Two, in the shape of his amiable wife, added
herself to the list of my well-wishers. Mr. Sanborn had
just been burned out. His house took fire while he and
his wife were spending Christmas Day with a neighbor,
and burned so quickly that no article in it could
be saved. He had found in the ashes the charred remains
of his manuscript sermons, and had good hope of
being able to decipher them. As the pleasant minutes
passed in easy conversation, I could not help reflecting
on the instinctive hospitality of Western life. This
cosy corner in a mere hired bedroom had given me a
rest and a shelter which I should have been unwilling
to ask for in some streets of palaces which have been
familiar to me from my youth up."</p>


<p><br />The Association for the Advancement of Women
was a pioneer society, and did vital work for twenty-five
years. During the greater part of that time she
was its president. She never missed (save when in
Europe) one of its annual congresses, or one of the
mid-year conferences (of officers only) which she considered
of high moment. She worked for the Association
with a loving enthusiasm that never varied or
faltered; and it was a real grief to her when the changing
of the old order resolved it into its elements, to
take new shape in the larger and farther-reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
work of the General Federation of Clubs, and other
kindred societies.</p>

<p>Many of these may be called the children of
"A.A.W." The greatest service of the latter was in
founding women's clubs throughout the country.
Wherever they went, to conferences or conventions,
its leaders called about them the thoughtful women
of the neighborhood, and helped them to plan local
associations for study and work.</p>


<p><br />There was still another aspect of the Woman Question,
dearer to her even than "A.A.W."</p>

<p>A woman minister once said: "My conviction that
Mrs. Howe was a divinely ordained preacher was
gained the first time that she publicly espoused the
question of woman suffrage in 1869."</p>

<p>We have seen that little Julia Ward began her ministrations
in the nursery. At eight years old she was adjuring
her little cousin to love God and he would see
death approaching with joy. At eleven she was writing
her "Invitation to Youth":&mdash;</p>

<p>
Oh! let thy meditations be of God,<br />
Who guides thy footsteps with unerring eye;<br />
And who, until the path of life is trod,<br />
Will never leave thee by thyself to die.<br />
<br />
When morning's rays so joyously do shine,<br />
And nature brightens at the face of day,<br />
Oh! think then on the joys that shall be thine<br />
If thou wilt early walk the narrow way.<br />
</p>

<p>We have followed her through the Calvinistic period
of religious gloom and fervor; through the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
awakening that followed; through the years when she
could say to Philosophy,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"... The world its plenitude</span><br />
May keep, so I may share thy beggary."<br />
</p>

<p>These various phases were like divers-colored shades
covering a lamp: through them all the white flame of
religion burned clear and steady, fostered by a natural
piety which was as much a part of her as the
breath she drew.</p>

<p>In the year 1865 came the call to preach. She was
asked to speak before the Parker Fraternity in Boston.
She chose for her discourse a paper on "Ideal Causation,"
which she had thought "the crown of her
endeavor hitherto."</p>

<p>"To my sorrow, I found that it did not greatly interest
my hearers, and that one who was reported to
have wondered 'what Mrs. Howe was driving at' had
spoken the mind of many of those present.</p>

<p>"I laid this lesson much to heart, and, becoming
convinced that metaphysics did not supply the universal
solvent for human evils, I determined to find a <i>pou
sto</i> nearer to the sympathies of the average community,
from which I might speak for their good and my own.</p>

<p>"From my childhood the Bible had been dear and
familiar to me, and I now began to consider texts and
sermons, in place of the transcendental webs I had
grown so fond of spinning. The passages of Scripture
which now occurred to me filled me with a desire to
emphasize their wisdom by a really spiritual interpretation.
From this time on, I became more and more
interested in the religious ministration of women...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>Her first sermon was preached at Harrisburg in 1870.
Then followed the sermons in Santo Domingo, and
those of the Peace Crusade in London; from this time,
the Woman Ministry was one of the causes dearest to
her heart. The Journal from now on contains many
texts and notes for sermons.</p>

<p>In 1871, "What the lost things are which the Son of
Man came to save, lost values, lost jewels, darkened
souls, scattered powers, lost opportunities."</p>

<p>A year later: "Preached in the afternoon at the South
Portsmouth meetinghouse. Text, 'I will arise and go
unto my father,' Subject: 'The Fatherhood of God.'
I did as well as usual.... In the evening my text
was: 'Abide in me and I in you,' etc., but I was at
one moment so overcome with fatigue that the whole
thread of my discourse escaped me. I paused for a
moment, excused myself briefly to the congregation,
and was fortunate enough to seize the thread of my discourse
again, and got through quite well. I felt this
very much,&mdash;the fear of failure, I mean. The fatigue
was great and my brain felt it much. My dæmon told
me beforehand that I could not repeat this sermon
and had better read it. I shall believe him next time.
This is a difficult point, to know how far to trust the
dæmon. He is not to be implicitly trusted, nor yet to
be neglected. In these days I am forced to review the
folly and shortcomings of my life. My riper reason
shows me a sad record of follies and of faults. I seem
to sit by and listen sadly; no chastening for the present
is joyous but grievous."</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday, September 29.</i> Reverend Mrs. Gustine to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
dine. I afterwards to church to hear her. A sweet
woman, called of God, with a real power. Her voice,
manner, and countenance, most sweet and impressive.
Intellection not remarkable, I think, but tone, feeling,
and effect very remarkable. No one, I think, would
doubt the reality of spiritual things after hearing her.
I asked myself why I am not jealous of her, as she
preaches far more effectively than I do. Well, partly
because I believe in my own gift, such as it is, and
partly because what she does is natural, genuine, and
without pretence or pretension. Her present Society
was much disturbed by strife when she was called to
its care. No man, she told me, could have united the
opposing parties. A true woman could. This shows me
a work that women have to do in the Church as well
as elsewhere. Where men cannot make peace, they can.
Mrs. Gustine says that by my writings and example
I have helped her a good deal. I am glad to hear this,
but pray to do far better than I have yet done....
Thought much about Mrs. Gustine, who, without any
of my training and culture, can do what I cannot. I
can also do what she cannot&mdash;think a subject out.
She can only shadow and suggest, yet how powerful
is the contact of her soul, and what a good
power!"</p>

<p>"<i>Saturday, October 26.</i> To Vineyard Haven to help
Mr. Stevens with to-morrow's services.... Arrival
rainy and dismal. Mission house lonely in a storm.
Mr. S.'s young niece very capable and pleasant; did
the honors and took care of me. I was very hungry
before supper, having had nothing since breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
except a few chestnuts and a biscuit. Wondered a
little why I had come."</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday, 27th.</i> Found out why I had come.
Preached from text: 'Oh, that men would praise the
Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works,'
etc. Consider these wonderful works: the world we
live in, a human body and brain, a human soul.</p>

<p>"<i>Evening.</i> 'The ministry of reconciliation,' how
Christianity reconciles man to God, nature to spirit,
men to each other.</p>

<p>"I went through the two services entirely alone. I
felt supported and held up. I had hoped and prayed
this journey might bring some special good to some
one. It brought great comfort to me...."</p>


<p><br />On February 16, 1873, after hearing a powerful sermon,
she feels awakened to take up the work over
which she has dreamed so much, and talks with her
friend, Mary Graves, herself an ordained minister of
the Unitarian Church, about "our proposed Woman's
Mission here in Boston." A few days later she writes:
"Determine that my Sunday services must be held
and to see Redpath<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> in this connection."</p>

<p>The result of this determination was the organization
of the Woman's Liberal Christian Union, which held
Sunday afternoon meetings through the spring. She
preached the first sermon, on March 16. "I meant,"
she says, "to read my London sermon, but found it not
suitable. Wrote a new one as well as I could. Had a
very good attendance. Was forced to play the hymn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
tunes myself. Am thankful that the occasion seemed
to meet with acceptance."</p>

<p>In 1873, a number of women ministers having come
to Boston to attend the May Anniversaries, she conceived
the idea of bringing them together in a meeting
all their own. She issued a call for a Woman Preachers'
Convention, and this convention, the first held in any
country, met on May 29, 1873. She was elected president,
the Reverends Mary H. Graves and Olympia
Brown vice-presidents, Mrs. Bruce secretary. The
Journal describes this meeting as "most harmonious
and happy."</p>

<p>In 1893, speaking of this time, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I find that it is just twenty years, last spring, since
I made the first effort to gather in one body the women
who intended to devote themselves to the ministry.</p>

<p>"The new liberties of utterance which the discussion
of woman suffrage had brought us seemed at this time
not only to invite, but to urge upon us a participation
in the advocacy of the most vital interests both of the
individual and of the community. With some of us,
this advocacy naturally took the form of preaching.
Pulpits were offered us on all sides, and the charm of
novelty lent itself to such merit and power as Nature
had vouchsafed us. I am so much of a natural church-woman,
I might say an ecclesiast, that I at once began
to dream of a church of true womanhood. I felt how
much the masculine administration of religious doctrine
had overridden us women, and I felt how partial
and one-sided a view of these matters had been inculcated
by men, and handed down by man-revering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
mothers. Now, I thought, we have got hold of what
is really wanting in the Church universal. We need
to have the womanly side of religion represented. Without
this representation, we shall not have the fulness
of human thought for the things that most deeply concern
it. As a first step, I undertook to hold religious
services on Sunday afternoons, and to secure for them
the assistance of as many woman preachers as I could
hear of. I had in this undertaking the assistance of my
valued friend, Reverend Mary H. Graves."</p>

<p>The society thus formed was first called "The
Woman's Church," later, "The Woman's Ministerial
Conference." A second meeting was held, June 1,
1874, but it was not till 1892 that this Conference was
finally organized and established, to her great satisfaction.
She was elected its president, and held the
office till death.</p>

<p>The secretary, Reverend Ada C. Bowles, says of
this Conference: "As its main object was to promote
a sense of fellowship, rather than to expect associated
labor, owing to the scattered membership, meetings
were not always regularly held, or possible. But it has
held together because Mrs. Howe loved it, and had a
secretary as loyal to her as she was to all the women
ministers."</p>

<p>She herself has said: "I was impressed with the
importance of religious life, and believed in the power
of association. I believed that women ministers would
be less sectarian than men; and I thought that if those
of different denominations could meet occasionally and
compare notes, it would be of value."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>After the formal conference, she welcomed the members
at her own house, talked with them, and heard
of their doings. Her eyes kindled as she heard of the
Wayside Chapel (of Malden, Massachusetts) built by
its pastor, Mrs. E. M. Bruce, who was also its trustee,
janitor, choir, and preacher; heard how for thirteen
years this lady had rung the bell every evening for
vesper service, and had never lacked a congregation:
or of the other woman who was asked "very diffidently"
if she would conduct the funeral services of an
honest and upright man who had died of drink, owing
to an inherited tendency.</p>

<p>"They had expected to have it in the undertaker's
rooms," said the Reverend Florence Buck, of Wisconsin,
"but we had it in my own church. It was
packed with people of all sorts, who had been interested
in him; and the Bartenders' Union were there in
a body.... It was an opportunity that I would not
have given up to preach to the President and Senate
of the United States. Next day ... they said, 'We
expected she'd wallop us to hell; but she talked to us
like a mother!'"</p>

<p>Then she turned to the president, and said, "The
woman minister is often lonely. I want to thank Mrs.
Howe, who welcomed me at the beginning of my ministry.
Her hand-clasp has stayed with me ever since."</p>

<p>Our mother was never ordained: it is doubtful
whether she ever contemplated such a step; but she felt
herself consecrated to the work; wherever she was
asked to preach, she went as if on wings, feeling this
call more sacred than any other. She preached in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
parts of the country, from Maine to California, from
Minnesota to Louisiana; but the pulpit in which she
felt most truly at home was that of the Church of the
Disciples. Mr. Clarke had first welcomed her there:
his successor, Charles Gordon Ames, became in turn
her valued friend and pastor.</p>

<p>The congregation were all her friends. On Sundays
they gathered round her after service, with greetings
and kind words. She was ready enough to respond.
"Congregationing," as she called this little function,
was her delight; after listening devoutly to the sermon,
there was always a reaction to her gayest mood. Her
spirit came to church with folded hands of prayer, but
departed on dancing feet. Sometimes she reproached
herself with over-friskiness; but mostly she was too
wise for this, and let the sun shine when and where
it would.</p>

<p>She preached many times in the Church of the Disciples.
The white-clad figure, the clasped hands, the
upturned face shining with the inner light, will be
remembered by some who read these pages.</p>

<h3>EUROPE REVISITED</h3>

<h4>1877; <i>aet.</i> 58</h4>

<p>A MOMENT'S MEDITATION IN COLOGNE CATHEDRAL</p>

<p>
Enter Life's high cathedral<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With reverential heart,</span><br />
Its lofty oppositions<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Matched with divinest art.</span><br />
<br />
Thought with its other climbing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To meet and blend on high;</span><br />
Man's mortal and immortal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wed for eternity.</span><br />
<br />
When noon's high mass is over,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Muse in the silent aisles;</span><br />
Wait for the coming vespers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In which new promise smiles.</span><br />
<br />
When from the dome height echoes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An "<i>Ite, missa est</i>,"</span><br />
Whisper thy last thanksgiving,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Depart, and take thy rest.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">J. W. H.</span><br />
</p>


<p><br />From the time of the Doctor's death till her marriage
in 1887, the youngest daughter was her mother's companion
and yoke-fellow. In all records of travel, of
cheer, of merriment, she can say thankfully: "<i>Et ego
in Arcadia vixi</i>."</p>

<p>The spring of 1877 found the elder comrade weary
with much lecturing and presiding, the younger somewhat
out of health. Change of air and scene was prescribed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4b" id="Page_4b ">[4]</a></span>
and the two sailed for Europe early in May.</p>

<p>Throughout the journeyings which followed, our
mother had two objects in view: to see her own kind
of people, the seekers, the students, the reformers, and
their works; and to give Maud the most vivid first impression
of all that would be interesting and valuable
to her. These objects were not always easy to combine.</p>

<p>After a few days at Chester (where she laments the
"restoration" of the fine old oak of the cathedral,
"now shining like new, after a boiling in potash") and
a glimpse of Hawarden and Warwick, they proceeded
to London and took lodgings in Bloomsbury (a quarter
of high fashion when she first knew London, now given
over to lodgings). Once settled, she lost no time in
establishing relations with friends old and new. The
Unitarian Association was holding its annual conference;
one of the first entries in the Journal tells of
her attending the Unitarian breakfast where she spoke
about "the poor children and the Sunday schools."</p>

<p>Among her earliest visitors was Charles Stewart
Parnell, of whom she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Delia Stewart Parnell, whom I had known
in America, had given me a letter of introduction to her
son, Charles, who was already conspicuous as an advocate
of Home Rule for Ireland. He called upon me
and appointed a day when I should go with him to the
House of Commons. He came in his brougham and
saw me safely deposited in the ladies' gallery. He was
then at the outset of his stormy career, and his sister
Fanny told me that he had in Parliament but one supporter
of his views, 'a man named Biggar.' He certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5b" id="Page_5b">[5]</a></span>
had admirers elsewhere, for I remember having
met a disciple of his, O'Connor by name, at a 'rout'
given by Mrs. Justin McCarthy. I asked this lady if
her husband agreed with Mr. Parnell. She replied with
warmth, 'Of course; we are all Home Rulers here.'"</p>


<p><br />"<i>May 26.</i> To Floral Hall concert, where heard
Patti&mdash;and many others&mdash;a good concert. In the
evening to Lord Houghton's, where made acquaintance
of Augustus Hare, author of 'Memorials of a
Quiet Life,' etc., with Mrs. Proctor, Mrs. Singleton
[Violet Fane], Dr. and Mrs. Schliemann, and others,
among them Edmund Yates. Lord Houghton was most
polite and attentive. Robert Browning was there."</p>


<p><br />Whistler was of the party that evening. His hair was
then quite black, and the curious white forelock which
he wore combed high like a feather, together with his
striking dress, made him one of the most conspicuous
figures in the London of that day. Henry Irving came
in late: "A rather awkward man, whose performance of
'Hamlet' was much talked of at that time." She met
the Schliemanns often, and heard Mrs. Schliemann
speak before the Royal Geographical Society, where
she made a plea for the modern pronunciation of Greek.
In order to help her husband in his work, Mrs. Schliemann
told her, she had committed to memory long
passages from Homer which proved of great use to
him in his researches at Mycenæ and Tiryns.</p>

<p><br />"<i>May 27....</i> Met Mr. and Mrs. Wood&mdash;he has
excavated the ruins at Ephesus, and has found the site<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6b" id="Page_6b">[6]</a></span>
of the Temple of Diana. His wife has helped him in his
work, and having some practical experience in the use
of remedies, she gave much relief to the sick men and
women of the country."</p>

<p>"<i>June 2.</i> Westminster Abbey at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> ... I enjoyed
the service, Mendelssohn's 'Hymn of Praise,'
Dean Stanley's sermon, and so on, very unusually.
Edward Twisleton seemed to come back to me, and so
did dear Chev, and a spiritual host of blessed ones who
have passed within the veil...."</p>

<p>"<i>June 14.</i> Breakfast with Mr. Gladstone. Grosvenor
Gallery with the Seeleys. Prayer meeting at Lady
Gainsborough's.</p>

<p>"We were a little early, for Mrs. Gladstone complained
that the flowers ordered from her country seat
had but just arrived. A daughter of the house proceeded
to arrange them. Breakfast was served at two
round tables, exactly alike.</p>

<p>"I was glad to find myself seated between the great
man and the Greek minister, John Gennadius. The
talk ran a good deal upon Hellenics, and I spoke of the
influence of the Greek in the formation of the Italian
language, to which Mr. Gladstone did not agree. I
know that scholars differ on the point, but I still retain
the opinion I expressed. I ventured a timid remark
regarding the number of Greek derivatives used in our
common English speech. Mr. Gladstone said very
abruptly, 'How? What? English words derived from
Greek?' and almost</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">
'Frightened Miss Muffet away.'</span>
</p>

<p>"He is said to be habitually disputatious, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7b" id="Page_7b">[7]</a></span>
thought that this must certainly be the case; for he
surely knew better than most people how largely and
familiarly we incorporate the words of Plato, Aristotle,
and Xenophon in our everyday talk."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>


<p><br />Mr. Gladstone was still playing the first rôle on the
stage of London life. Our mother notes hearing him
open the discussion that followed Mrs. Schliemann's
address before the Royal Geographical Society. Lord
Rosebery, who was at that time Mr. Gladstone's private
secretary, talked much of his chief, for whom he
expressed impassioned devotion. Rosebery, though he
must have been a man past thirty at the time, looked a
mere boy. His affection for "Uncle Sam" Ward was as
loyal as that for his chief, and it was on his account
that he paid our mother some attention when she was
in London.</p>

<p>She always remembered this visit as one of the most
interesting of the many she made to the "province in
brick." She was driving three horses abreast,&mdash;her
own life, Maud's life, the life of London. She often
spoke of the great interest of seeing so many different
circles of London society; likening it to a layer cake,
which a fortunate stranger is able to cut through, enjoying
a little of each. Her modest Bloomsbury lodgings
were often crowded by the leaders of the world of
letters, philanthropy, and art, and some even of the
world of fashion. The little lodging-house "slavey"
was often awed by the titles on the cards she invariably
presented between a work-worn thumb and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8b" id="Page_8b">[8]</a></span>
finger. It is curious to contrast the brief record of
these days with that of the Peace Crusade.</p>


<p><br />"<i>June 10.</i> To morning service at the Foundling
Hospital&mdash;very touching. To luncheon with M. G. D.
where met the George Howards."</p>

<p>"<i>June 15....</i> 'Robert' [opera] with Richard
Mansfield."</p>

<p>"<i>June 18.</i> Synagogue."</p>

<p>"<i>June 19.</i> Lord Mayor's Mansion House. I am to
speak there concerning Laura Bridgman. Henry James
may come to take me to St. Bart.'s Hospital."</p>

<p>"<i>June 25.</i> 'Messiah.' Miss Bryce."</p>

<p>"<i>June 26.</i> Dined with Capt. Ward. Theatre. Justin
McCarthy."</p>

<p>"<i>June 28.</i> Meeting in Lambeth Library."</p>

<p>"<i>June 29.</i> Russell Gurney's garden party.</p>

<p>"Miss Marston's, Onslow Sq., 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Anti-vivisection.
Met Dudley Campbell. A day of rest, indeed. I
wrote out my anti-vivisection argument for to-morrow,
and finished the second letter to the Chicago 'Tribune.'
Was thus alone nearly all day. Dined at Brentini's in
my old fashion, chop, tea, and beer, costing one shilling
and fivepence."</p>


<p><br />She remembered with pleasure an evening spent
with the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire at Devonshire
House. A ball at Mr. Goschen's was another evening
of enchantment, as was also the dinner given for
her at Greenwich by Edmund Yates, where she had a
good talk with Mr. Mallock, whose "New Republic"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9b" id="Page_9b">[9]</a></span>
was one of the books of that season. She managed, too,
sometimes to be at home; among her visitors were
William Black, John Richard Green, and Mr. Knowles,
editor of the "Nineteenth Century."</p>

<p>The London visit lasted nearly two months; as the
engagements multiply, its records grow briefer and
briefer. There are many entries like the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Breakfast with Lord Houghton, where met Lord
Granville and M. Waddington, late Minister of Education
in France. Garden party at Chiswick in the
afternoon. Prince of Wales there with his eldest son,
Prince Albert Victor. Mrs. Julian Goldsmith's ball
in the evening."</p>

<p>It is remembered that she bravely watched the
dancers foot it through the livelong night, and drove
home by daylight, with her "poor dancing Maud"!</p>

<p>Madame Waddington was formerly Miss King, the
granddaughter of Mr. Ward's old partner. Our mother
was always interested in meeting any descendants
of Prime, Ward &amp; King.</p>

<p>With all this, she was writing letters for the Chicago
"Tribune" and the "Woman's Journal." This
year of 1877 saw the height of the Æsthetic movement.
Mrs. Langtry, the "Jersey Lily," was the
beauty and toast of the season. Gilbert and Sullivan's
"Patience" was the dramatic hit of the year, and
"Greenery yallery, Grosvenor Gallery" the most popular
catch of the day.</p>

<p>She found it hard to tear herself away from England;
the visit (which she likened to one at the house
of an adored grandmother) was over all too soon. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10b" id="Page_10b">[10]</a></span>
July was almost gone; and the two travellers finally
left the enchanted island for Holland, recalling Emerson's
advice to one going abroad for the first time:
"A year for England, and a year for the rest of the
world!"</p>

<p>The much neglected Journal now takes up the story.</p>

<p>The great Franz Hals pictures delighted her beyond
measure. She always bought the best reproductions
she could afford, and valued highly an etching that
she owned from his Bohémienne. She never waited
for any authority to admire either a work of art or
a person. She had much to say about the influence
of the Dutch blood both in our own family and in our
country, which was to her merely a larger family connection.
All through Holland she was constantly noting
customs and traditions which we seemed to have
inherited; and she felt a great likeness and sympathy
between herself and some of the Dutch people she
knew.</p>


<p><br />"<i>The Hague.</i> To the old prison where the instruments
of torture are preserved. The prison itself is so
dark and bare that to stay therein was a living death.
To this was often added the most cruel torture. The
poor wretch was stretched on a cross, on which revolving
wheels, turned by a crank, agonized and destroyed
his spinal column&mdash;or, by another machine,
his head and feet were drawn in opposite directions&mdash;or,
his limbs were stretched out and every bone broken
with an iron bar. Tortures of fire and water were
added. Through all these horrors, I saw the splendors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11b" id="Page_11b">[11]</a></span>
of faith and conscience which illuminated these dungeons,
and which enabled frail humanity to bear these
inflictions without flinching."</p>

<p>She always wanted to see the torture chambers. She
listened to all the detailed explanations and looked at
all the dreadful instruments, buoyed up by the thought
of the splendors she speaks of, when mere shrinking
flesh-and-blood creatures like her companion, who only
thought of the poor tortured bodies, could not bear
the strain of it.</p>

<p>From The Hague they went to Amsterdam, where
they "worked hard at seeing the rich museum, which
contains some of the largest and best of Rembrandt's
pictures, and much else of interest"; thence to Antwerp.
Here she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To the Museum, where saw the glorious Rubens
and Van Dycks, together with the Quentin Matsys
triptych. Went to the Cathedral, and saw the dear
Rubens pictures&mdash;my Christ in the Elevation of the
Cross seemed to me as wonderful as ever. The face
asks, 'Why hast thou forsaken me?' but seems also
to reflect the answer, from the very countenance of
the Father. Education of the Virgin by Rubens&mdash;angels
hold a garland above the studious head of the
young Madonna. This would be a good picture for
Vassar."</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday, July 29.</i> Up betimes&mdash;to high mass at
the Cathedral. Had a seat near the Descent, and saw
it better than ever before. Could not see the Elevation
so well, but feasted my eyes on both. Went later
to the church of St. Paul where Rubens's Flagellation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12b" id="Page_12b">[12]</a></span>
is. Found it very beautiful. At 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> M. Félu<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
came to take us to the Zoo, which is uncommonly
good. The collection of beasts from Africa is very rich.
They are also successful in raising wild beasts, having
two elephants, a tiger, and three giraffes which have
been born in the cages&mdash;some young lions also. The
captive lioness always destroyed her young, and these
were saved by being given to a dog to nurse...."</p>


<p><br />August found the travellers in Prussia.</p>

<p>"Passed the day in Berlin.... At night took railroad
for Czerwinsk, travelling second-class. After securing
our seats, as we supposed, we left the cars to
get some refreshments, when a man and a woman displaced
our effects, and took our places. The woman
refused to give me my place, and annoyed me by pushing
and crowding me."</p>

<p>The brutality of this couple was almost beyond belief.
She was always so gracious to fellow-travellers
that they usually "made haste to be kind" in return.
She made it a point to converse with the intelligent-looking
people she met, either in the train or at the
<i>tables d'hôte</i> then still in vogue. She talked with these
chance acquaintances of their country or their profession.
It was never mere idle conversation.</p>

<p>This journey across Europe was undertaken solely
for the pleasure of seeing her sister, always her first
object in visiting Europe. The bond between them
was very strong, spite of the wide difference of their
natures and the dissimilarity of their interests. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13b" id="Page_13b">[13]</a></span>
Terry was now visiting her eldest daughter, Annie
Crawford, married to Baron Eric von Rabé and living
at Lesnian in German Poland. Baron Eric had served
in the Franco-Prussian War with distinction, had been
seriously wounded, and obliged to retire from active
service. Here was an entirely new social atmosphere,
the most conservative in Europe. Even before the
travellers arrived, the shadow of formality had fallen
upon them; for Mrs. Terry had written begging that
they would arrive by "first-class"! At that time the
saying was, "Only princes, Americans, and fools travel
first-class," and our mother's rule had been to travel
second. The journey was already a great expense, and
the added cost seemed to her useless. Accordingly,
she bought second-class tickets to a neighboring station
and first-class ones from there to Czerwinsk. This
entailed turning out in the middle of the night and
waiting an hour for the splendid express carrying the
stiff and magnificently upholstered first-class carriages,
whose red plush seats and cushions were nothing like
so comfortable as the old grey, cloth-lined, second-class
carriages!</p>

<p>Still, the travellers arrived looking as proud as they
could, wearing their best frocks and bonnets. They
travelled with the Englishwoman's outfit. "Three
suits. Hightum, tightum, and scrub." "Hightum"
was for any chance festivity, "tightum" for the <i>table
d'hôte</i>, "scrub" for everyday travelling. The question
of the three degrees was anxiously discussed on
this occasion; it was finally decided that only "hightum"
would come up to the Von Rabé standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14b" id="Page_14b">[14]</a></span>"<i>August 4.</i> Arrived at Czerwinsk, where sister L.
and Baron von Rabé met us. He kissed my hand in a
courtly manner. My sister looks well, but has had a
hard time. We drove to Lesnian where Annie von R.
and her mother-in-law made us welcome."</p>

<p>"<i>August 9, Lesnian.</i> A quiet day at home, writing
and some work. Tea with Sister L. in the open air.
Then went with Baron von Rabé to visit his farm
buildings, which are very extensive; not so nicely finished
as would be the case in America. We got many
fleas in our clothes.... In the evening the Baron began
to dispute with me concerning the French and the
use and excellence of war, etc...."</p>

<p>"<i>August 12.</i> Up early&mdash;to Czerwinsk and thence
by Dirschau to Marienburg to see the famous Ritterschloss
of the Teutonic Knights.... Marien-Kirch....
Angel Michael weighing the souls, a triptych&mdash;the
good in right wing received by St. Peter and
clothed by angels, the wicked in the other wing
going down. The beautiful sheen of the Archangel&mdash;like
peacock brightness&mdash;a devil with butterfly
wings."</p>

<p>"<i>August 14.</i> In the church yesterday we were shown
five holes in a flat tombstone. They say that a parricide
was buried beneath this stone, and the fingers
of his hand forced themselves through these holes.
They showed us this hand, dried, and hung up in a
chapel. Here also we saw a piece of embroidery in fine
pearls, formerly belonging to the Catholic service, and
worth thousands of dollars. Some very ancient priests'
garments, with Arabic designs, were said to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15b" id="Page_15b">[15]</a></span>
brought from the East by the Crusaders. An astronomic
clock is shown in the church. The man who made
it set about making another, but was made blind lest
he should do so. By and by, pretending that he must
repair or regulate something in the clock, he so puts it
out of order that it never goes again.</p>

<p>"The amber-merchant&mdash;the felt shoes&mdash;views of
America&mdash;the lecture&mdash;the Baltic."</p>


<p><br />She was enchanted with Dantzig. The ancient
Polish Jews in their long cloth gabardines, with their
hair dressed in two curls worn in front of the ear and
hanging down on either side of the face, showed her
how Shylock must have looked. She was far more
interested in the relics of the old Polish civilization
than in the crude, brand-new Prussian régime which
was replacing it; but this did not suit her hosts. The
peasants who worked on the estate were all Poles; the
relations between them and their employer smacked
strongly of serfdom. One very intelligent man, who
often drove her, was called Zalinski. It struck her that
this man might be related to her friend Lieutenant
Zalinski, of the United States Army. She asked him if
he had any relatives in America. He replied that a
brother of his had gone to America many years before.
He seemed deeply interested in the conversation
and tried once or twice to renew it. One of the family,
who was driving with our mother at the time, managed
to prevent any more talk about the American
Zalinski, and when the drive was over she was seriously
called to account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16b" id="Page_16b">[16]</a></span>"Can you not see that it would be extremely unfortunate
if one of our servants should learn that any
relative of his could possibly be a friend of one of our
guests?"</p>

<p>She was never allowed to see Zalinski again; on inquiring
for him, she learned that he had been sent to a
fair with horses to sell. He did not return to Lesnian
during the remainder of her stay.</p>

<p>One of the picturesque features of the visit was the
celebration of Baron Eric's birthday. It was a general
holiday, and no work was done on the estate. After
breakfast family and guests assembled in front of the
old château; the baron, a fine, soldierly-looking man,
his wife, the most graceful of women, and the only
daughter, a lovely little girl with the well-chiselled
Crawford features. The peasants, dressed in their best,
assembled in procession in the driveway; one by one,
in order of their age or position, they came up the steps,
presented the Baroness with a bouquet, bent the knee
and kissed the hand of Baron and Baroness. To most of
the guests the picture was full of Old-World romance
and charm. To one it was an offence. That the granddaughter
of her father, the child of her adored sister,
should have been placed by fate in this feudal relationship
to the men and women by whose labor she lived
outraged her democratic soul.</p>

<p>The Journal thus describes the days at Lesnian:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Baron talked much last evening, first about
his crops, then about other matters. He believes duelling
to be the most efficient agency in promoting a
polite state of society. Would kill any one whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17b" id="Page_17b">[17]</a></span>
suspected of great wrong much sooner than bring him
to justice. The law, he says, is slow and uncertain&mdash;the
decision of the sword much more effectual. The
present Government favors duelling. If he should kill
some one in a duel, he would have two months of imprisonment
only. He despises the English as a nation
of merchants. The old German knights seem to be his
models. With these barbarous opinions, he seems to
be personally an amiable and estimable man. Despises
University education, in whose course he might have
come in contact with the son of a carpenter, or small
shopkeeper&mdash;he himself went to a Gymnase, with
sons of gentlemen...."</p>

<p>"Everything in the Junkerschaft<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> bristles for another
war. Oscar von Rabé's room, in which I now
write, contains only books of military drill.</p>

<p>"This day we visited the schoolhouse&mdash;session
over, air of the room perfectly fetid. Schoolmaster,
whom we did not see, a Pole&mdash;his sister could speak
no German. Tattered primers in German. Visited the
Jew, who keeps the only shop in Lesnian. Found a
regular country assortment. He very civil. <i>Gasthaus</i>
opposite, a shanty, with a beer-glass, coffee-cup and
saucer rudely painted on its whitewashed boards.
Shoemaker in a damp hovel, with mahogany furniture,
quite handsome. He made me a salaam with both
hands raised to his head."</p>

<p>"We went to call upon Herr von Rohr, at Schenskowkhan&mdash;an
extensive estate. I had put on my
Cheney silk and my bonnet as a great parade. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18b" id="Page_18b">[18]</a></span>
host showed us his house, his books and engravings&mdash;he
has several etchings by Rembrandt. Herr von
Mechlenberg, public librarian of Königsberg, a learned
little old man, trotted round with us. We had coffee
and waffles. Mechlenberg considers the German
tongue a very ancient one, an original language, not
patched up like French and English, of native dialects
mingled with Latin."</p>

<p>In one of her letters to the Chicago "Tribune" is a
significant passage written from Lesnian:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Having seen in one of the Dantzig papers the announcement
that a certain Professor Blank would soon
deliver a lecture upon America, showing the folly of
headlong emigration thither and the ill fortune which
many have wrought for themselves thereby, one of us
remarked to a Dantziger that in such a lecture many
untruths would probably be uttered. Our friend replied,
with a self-gratulatory laugh, 'Ah, Madame!
We Germans know all about the women of America.
A German woman is devoted to her household, its care
and management; but the American women all force
their husbands to live in hotels in order that they may
have no trouble in housekeeping.'"</p>

<p>She was as sensitive to criticism of her country as
some people are to criticism of their friends. Throughout
her stay in Germany she suffered from the captious
and provoking tone of the Prussian press about things
American.</p>

<p>Even in the churches she met this note of unfriendliness.
She took the trouble to transcribe in her Journal
an absurd newspaper story.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19b" id="Page_19b">[19]</a></span>
"An American Woman of Business<br />
</p>

<p>"Some little time since, a man living near Niagara
Falls had the misfortune to fall from the bridge leading
to Goat's Island. [Berlin paper says <i>Grat</i> Island.] He
was immediately hurried to the edge of the fearful
precipice. Here, he was able to cling to a ledge of rock,
and to support himself for half an hour, until his unavoidable
fate overtook him. A compassionate and
excited multitude rushed to the shore, and into the
house, where the unhappy wife was forced to behold
the death struggle of her husband, lost beyond all
rescue, this spot yielding the best view of the scene of
horror. The 'excellent' wife had too much coolness to
allow this opportunity of making money to escape her,
but collected from every person present one dollar for
window rent. (Berliner <i>Fremdenblatt</i>, Sunday, August
26, 1877.)"</p>


<p><br />The stab was from a two-edged sword; she loved
profoundly the great German writers and composers.
She was ever conscious of the debt she owed to Germany's
poets, philosophers, and musicians. Goethe
had been one of her earliest sources of inspiration,
Kant her guide through many troublous years; Beethoven
was like some great friend whose hand had led
her along the heights, when her feet were bleeding from
the stones of the valley. These were the Germans she
knew; her Germany was theirs. Now she came in contact
with this new <i>Junker</i> Germany, this harsh, military,
unlovely country where Bismarck was the ruling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20b" id="Page_20b">[20]</a></span>
spirit, and Von Moltke the idol of the hour. It was a
rough awakening for one who had lived in the gentler
Fatherland of Schiller and of Schubert.</p>


<p><br />"<i>August 31, Berlin.</i> Up early, and with carriage to
see the review.... A great military display. The Emperor
punctual at 10. '<i>Guten Morgen!</i>' shouted the
troops when he came. The Crown Princess on horseback
with a blue badge, Hussar cap. The kettle-drum
man had his reins hitched, one on either foot, guiding
his horse in this way, and beating his drums with both
hands...."</p>


<p><br />The Crown Princess, later the Empress Frederick,
daughter of Queen Victoria, and mother of the present
German Emperor, was the honorary colonel of the
hussar regiment whose uniform she wore, with the
addition of a plain black riding-skirt. Civilization
owes this lady a debt that cannot be paid save in
grateful remembrance. During the Franco-Prussian
War she frequently telegraphed to the German officers
commanding in France, urging them to spare the works
of art in the conquered country. Through her efforts
the studios of Rosa Bonheur and other famous painters
escaped destruction.</p>


<p><br />The early part of September was spent in Switzerland.
Chamounix filled the travellers with delight.
They walked up the Brevant, rode to the Mer de
Glace on muleback. The great feature, however, of
this visit to Switzerland was the Geneva Congress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21b" id="Page_21b">[21]</a></span>
called by Mrs. Josephine Butler to protest against the
legalizing of vice in England.</p>


<p><br />"At the Congress to-day&mdash;spoke in French.... I
spoke of the two sides, active and passive, of human
nature, and of the tendency of the education given to
women to exaggerate the passive side of their character,
whereby they easily fall victims to temptation. Spoke
of the exercise of the intellectual faculties as correcting
these tendencies&mdash;education of women in America&mdash;progress
made. Coeducation and the worthier relations
it induces between young men and women.
Said, where society thinks little of women, it teaches
them to think little of themselves. Said of marriage,
that Milton's doctrine, 'He for God only, she for God
in him,' was partial and unjust. '<i>Ce Dieu, il faut le
mettre entre les deux, de manière que chacun des deux
appartienne premièrement à Dieu, puis tous les deux
l'un à l'autre.</i>'"</p>

<p>"Wish to take up what Blank said to-day of the
superiority of man. Woman being created second.
That is no mark of inferiority. Shall say, this doctrine
of inequality very dangerous. Inferior position, inferior
education, legal status, etc. Doctrine of morality
quite opposite. If wife patient and husband not, wife
superior&mdash;if wife chaste, husband not, wife superior.
Each indispensable to each other, and to the whole.
Gentlemen, where would you have been if we had not
cradled and tended you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Congress....</i> Just before the end of the meeting
Mr. Stuart came to me and said that Mrs. Butler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22b" id="Page_22b">[22]</a></span>
wished me to speak for five minutes. After some hesitation
I said that I would try. Felt much annoyed at
being asked so late. Went up to the platform and did
pretty well in French. The audience applauded,
laughing a little at some points. In fact, my little
speech was a decided success with the French-speaking
part of the audience. Two or three Englishwomen
who understood very little of it found fault with me
for occasioning laughter. To the banquet...."</p>

<p>"<i>September 23.</i> This morning Mrs. Sheldon Ames
and her brother came to ask whether I would go to
Germany on a special mission. Miss Bolte also wished
me to go to Baden Baden to see the Empress of Germany."</p>

<p>"<i>September 24.</i> A conference of Swiss and English
women at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> A sister of John Stuart Mill spoke,
like the other English ladies, in very bad French.
'<i>Nous femmes</i>' said she repeatedly. She seemed a
good woman, but travelled far from the subject of the
meeting, which was the work to be done to carry out
what the Congress had suggested. Mrs. Blank, of
Bristol, read a paper in the worst French I ever heard.
'<i>Ouvrager</i>' for '<i>travailler</i>' was one of her mistakes."</p>


<p><br />In spite of some slight criticisms on the management
of this Congress, she was heart and soul in sympathy
with its object; and until the last day of her life,
never ceased to battle for the higher morality which at
all costs protests against the legalizing of vice.</p>

<p>Before leaving Geneva she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To Ferney in omnibus. The little church with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23b" id="Page_23b">[23]</a></span>
inscription '<i>Deo erexit Voltaire</i>,' and the date.... I
remember visiting Ferney with dear Chev; remember
that he did not wish me to see the model [of Madame
Du Châtelet's monument] lest it should give me gloomy
thoughts about my condition&mdash;she died in childbirth,
and the design represents her with her infant bursting
the tomb."</p>


<p><br />October found the travellers in Paris, the elder still
intent on affairs of study and reform, the younger
grasping eagerly at each new wonder or beauty.</p>

<p>There were meetings of the Academy of Fine Arts,
the Institute of France, the Court of Assizes: teachers'
meetings, too, and dinners with deaconesses (whom
she found a pleasant combination of cheerfulness and
gravity), and with friends who took her to the theatre.</p>

<p>"To Palais de Justice. Court of Assizes&mdash;a young
man to be condemned for an offence against a girl of
ten or twelve, and then to be tried for attempt to kill
his brother and brother-in-law....</p>

<p>"We were obliged to leave before the conclusion of
the trial, but learned that its duration was short, ending
in a verdict of guilty, and sentence of death. In
the days that followed our thoughts often visited this
unfortunate man in his cell, so young, apparently without
friends&mdash;his nearest relatives giving evidence
against him, and, in fact, bringing the suit that cost
his life. It seems less than Mosaic justice to put a man
to death for a murder which, though attempted, was
not actually committed. A life for a life is the old doctrine.
This is a life for an attempt upon a life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24b" id="Page_24b">[24]</a></span>An essay on Paris, written soon after, recalls further
memories. She visited the French Parliament, and was
surprised at the noise and excitement which prevailed.</p>

<p>"The presiding officer agitates his bell again and
again, to no purpose. He constantly cries, in piteous
tone: 'Gentlemen, a little silence, if you please.'"</p>

<p>She tells how "one of the ushers with great pride
pointed out Victor Hugo in his seat," and says further:</p>

<p>"I have seen this venerable man of letters several
times,&mdash;once in his own house.... We were first shown
into an anteroom, and presently into a small drawing-room.
The venerable viscount kissed my hand ... with
the courtesy belonging to other times. He was of
middle height, reasonably stout. His eyes were dark
and expressive, and his hair and beard were snow-white.
Several guests were present.... Victor Hugo
seated himself alone upon a sofa, and talked to no one.
While the rest of the company kept up a desultory
conversation, a servant announced M. Louis Blanc,
and our expectations were raised only to be immediately
lowered, for at this announcement Victor Hugo arose
and withdrew into another room, from which we were
able to hear the two voices in earnest conversation...."</p>

<p>"<i>November 27.</i> Packing to leave Paris to-night for
Turin. The blanks left in my diary do not mark idle
days. I have been exceedingly busy, ... have written
at least five newspaper letters, and some other correspondence.
Grieved this morning over the time
wasted at shop windows, in desiring foolish articles
which I could not afford to buy, especially diamonds,
which I do not need for my way of life. Yet I have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25b" id="Page_25b">[25]</a></span>
more good from my stay in Paris than this empty
Journal would indicate. Have seen many earnest men
and women&mdash;have delivered a lecture in French&mdash;have
started a club of English and American women
students, for which <i>Deo gratias!</i> Farewell, dear Paris,
God keep and save thee!"</p>


<p><br />She mentions this club in the "Reminiscences." "I
found in Paris a number of young women, students
of art and medicine, who appeared to lead very isolated
lives and to have little or no acquaintance with
one another. The need of a point of social union for
these young people appearing to me very great, I invited
a few of them to meet me at my lodgings. After
some discussion we succeeded in organizing a small
club, which, I am told, still exists.... [If we are not
mistaken, this small club was a mustard seed which in
time grew into the goodly tree of the American Girls'
Club.] I was invited several times to speak while in
Paris.... I spoke in French without notes.... Before
leaving Paris I was invited to take part in a congress
of woman's rights. It was deemed proper to elect
two presidents for this occasion, and I had the honor
of being chosen as one of them....</p>

<p>"Somewhat in contrast with these sober doings was
a ball given by the artist Healy at his residence. I had
told Mrs. Healy in jest that I should insist upon dancing
with her husband. Soon after my entrance she
said to me, 'Mrs. Howe, your quadrille is ready for
you. See what company you are to have.' I looked
and beheld General Grant and M. Gambetta, who led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26b" id="Page_26b">[26]</a></span>
out Mrs. Grant, while her husband had Mrs. Healy for
his partner in the quadrille of honor.... Marshal
MacMahon was at this time President of the French
Republic. I attended an evening reception given by
him in honor of General and Mrs. Grant. Our host
was supposed to be at the head of the Bonapartist
faction, and I heard some rumors of an intended <i>coup
d'état</i> which should bring back imperialism and place
Plon-Plon [the nickname for Prince Napoleon] on the
throne.... I remember Marshal MacMahon as a
man of medium height, with no very distinguishing
feature. He was dressed in uniform and wore many
decorations."</p>

<p>During this visit to Paris, our mother consorted
largely with the men and women she had met at the
Geneva Congress. She takes leave of Paris with these
words: "Better than the filled trunk and empty purse,
which usually mark a return from Paris, will be a full
heart and a hand clasping across the water another
hand pure and resolute as itself."</p>


<p><br />The two comrades journeyed southward by way of
Turin, Milan, and Verona. Of the last place the
Journal says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Busy in Verona&mdash;first, amphitheatre, with its
numerous cells, those of the wild beasts wholesomely
lighted and aired, those of the prisoners, dark and
noisome and often without light of any kind.... Then
to the tombs of the Scaligers&mdash;grim and beautiful.
Can Signoria who killed his brother was the last. Can
Grande, Dante's host."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27b" id="Page_27b">[27]</a></span>In Verona she was full of visions of the great poet
whose exile she describes in the poem called, "The
Price of the Divina Commedia." One who met her
there remembers the extraordinary vividness of her impressions.
It was as if she had seen and talked with
Dante, had heard from his own lips how hard it was to
eat the salt and go up and down the stairs of others.</p>

<p>From Verona to Venice, thence to Bologna. Venice
was an old friend always revisited with delight. Bologna
was new to her; here she found traces of the notable
women of its past. In the University she was
shown the recitation room where the beautiful female
professor of anatomy is said to have given her lectures
from behind a curtain, in order that the students' attention
should not be distracted from her words of
wisdom by her beauty. In the picture gallery she
found out the work of Elisabetta Sirani, one of the
good painters of the Bolognese school.</p>

<p>And now, after twenty-seven years, her road led
once more to Rome.</p>

<p><br />The travellers arrived in Rome in good time for the
Christmas dinner at Palazzo Odescalchi, where they
found the Terrys and Marion Crawford. On December
31 our mother writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The last day of a year whose beginning found me
full of work and fatigue. Beginning for me in a Western
railway car, it ends in a Roman palace&mdash;a long stretch
of travel lying between. Let me here record that this
year has brought me much good and pleasure, as well
as some regrets. My European tour was undertaken
for dear Maud's sake. It took me away from the dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29b" id="Page_29b">[29]</a></span>
ones at home, and from opportunities of work which
I should have prized highly. I was President of the
Woman's Congress, and to be absent not only from its
meeting, but also from its preparatory work, caused me
great regret. On the other hand, I saw delightful people
in England, and have seen, besides the old remembered
delights, many places which I never visited
before.... I am now with my dear sister, around
whom the shadows of existence deepen. I am glad to
be with her; though I can do so little for her, she is
doing very much for me."</p>


<p><br />This was a season of extraordinary interest to one
who had always loved Italy and pleaded for a generous
policy toward her. Early in January it became known
that King Victor Emanuel was dying. At the Vatican
his life-long adversary Pius IX was wasting away with
a mortal disease. It was a time of suspense. The two
had fought a long and obstinate duel: which of them,
people asked, would yield first to the conqueror on the
pale horse? There were those among the "Blacks" of
Rome who would have denied the last sacrament to
the dying King. "No!" said Pio Nono; "he has always
been a good Catholic; he shall not die without the
sacrament!" On the 9th of January the King died, and
"the ransomed land mourned its sovereign as with one
heart."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>


<p><br />"<i>January 12.</i> Have just been to see the new King
[Umberto I] review the troops, and receive the oath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30b" id="Page_30b">[30]</a></span>
of allegiance from the army. The King's horse was
a fine light sorrel&mdash;he in full uniform, with light blue
trousers. In Piazza del Independenza. We at the
American Consulate. Much acclamation and waving
of handkerchiefs. Went at 5 in the afternoon to see the
dead King lying in state. His body was shown set on
an inclined plane, the foreshortening disfigured his
poor face dreadfully, making his heavy moustache
to look as if it were his eyebrows. Behind him a
beautiful ermine canopy reached nearly to the ceiling&mdash;below
him the crown and sceptre on a cushion.
Castellani's beautiful gold crown is to be buried with
him."</p>

<p>She says of the funeral:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The monarch's remains were borne in a crimson
coach of state, drawn by six horses. His own favorite
war-horse followed, veiled in crape, the stirrups holding
the King's boots and spurs, turned backward.
Nobles and servants of great houses in brilliant costumes,
bareheaded, carrying in their hands lighted
torches of wax.... As the cortège swept by, I dropped
my tribute of flowers.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>..."</p>

<p>"<i>January 19.</i> To Parliament, to see the mutual
taking of oaths between the new King and the Parliament.
Had difficulty in getting in. Sat on carpeted
stair near Mrs. Carson. Queen came at two in the
afternoon. Sat in a loggia ornamented with red velvet
and gold. Her entrance much applauded. With her
the little Prince of Naples,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> her son; the Queen of
Portugal, her sister-in-law; and Prince of Portugal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31b" id="Page_31b">[31]</a></span>
son of the latter. The King entered soon after two&mdash;he
took the oath standing bareheaded, then signed
some record of it. The oath was then administered
to Prince Amadeo and Prince de Carignan, then in
alphabetical order to the Senate and afterwards to the
Deputies."</p>

<p>A month later, Pio Nono laid down the burden of
his years. She says of this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pope Pius IX had reigned too long to be deeply
mourned by his spiritual subjects, one of whom remarked
in answer to condolence, 'I should think he
had lived long enough!'"</p>


<p><br />The winter passed swift as a dream, though not
without anxieties. Roman fever was then the bane of
American travellers, and while she herself suffered only
from a slight indisposition, Maud was seriously ill.
There was no time for her Journal, but some of the
impressions of that memorable season are recorded in
verse.</p>

<p>
Sea, sky, and moon-crowned mountain, one fair world,<br />
Past, Present, Future, one Eternity.<br />
Divine and human and informing soul,<br />
The mystic Trine thought never can resolve.<br />
</p>

<p>One of the great pleasures of this Roman visit was
the presence of her nephew Francis Marion Crawford.
He was then twenty-three years old, and extremely
handsome; some people thought him like the
famous bas-relief of Antinous at the Villa Albano.
The most genial and companionable of men, he devoted
himself to his aunt and was her guide to the <i>trattoria</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32b" id="Page_32b">[32]</a></span>
where Goethe used to dine, to Tasso's Oak, to
the innumerable haunts dedicated to the poets of
every age, who have left their impress on the Eternal
City.</p>

<p>Our mother always loved acting. Her nearest approach
to a professional appearance took place this
winter. Madame Ristori was in Rome, and had promised
to read at an entertainment in aid of some
charity. She chose for her selection the scene from
"Maria Stuart" where the unhappy Queen of Scots
meets Elizabeth and after a fierce altercation triumphs
over her. At the last moment the lady who was to
impersonate Elizabeth fell ill. What was to be done?
Some one suggested, "Mrs. Howe!" The "Reminiscences"
tell how she was "pressed into the service,"
and how the last rehearsal was held while the musical
part of the entertainment was going on. "Madame
Ristori made me repeat my part several times, insisting
that my manner was too reserved and would make
hers appear extravagant. I did my best to conform to
her wishes, and the reading was duly applauded."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Another performance was arranged in which Madame
Ristori gave the sleep-walking scene from "Macbeth."
The question arose as to who should take the
part of the attendant.</p>

<p>"Why not your sister?" said Ristori to Mrs. Terry.
"No one could do it better!"</p>

<p>In the spring, the travellers made a short tour in
southern Italy. One memory of it is given in the
following verses:&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33b" id="Page_33b">[33]</a></span>NEAR AMALFI</p>

<p>
Hurry, hurry, little town,<br />
With thy labor up and down.<br />
Clang the forge and roll the wheels,<br />
Spring the shuttle, twirl the reels.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Hunger comes.</span><br />
<br />
Every woman with her hand<br />
Shares the labor of the land;<br />
Every child the burthen bears,<br />
And the soil of labor wears.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Hunger comes.</span><br />
<br />
In the shops of wine and oil<br />
For the scanty house of toil;<br />
Give just measure, housewife grave,<br />
Thrifty shouldst thou be, and brave.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Hunger comes.</span><br />
<br />
Only here the blind man lags,<br />
Here the cripple, clothed with rags.<br />
Such a motley Lazarus<br />
Shakes his piteous cap at us.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Hunger comes.</span><br />
<br />
Oh! could Jesus pass this way<br />
Ye should have no need to pray.<br />
He would go on foot to see<br />
All your depths of misery.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Succor comes.</span><br />
<br />
He would smooth your frowzled hair,<br />
He would lay your ulcers bare,<br />
He would heal as only can<br />
Soul of God in heart of man.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Jesus comes.</span><br />
<br />
Ah! my Jesus! still thy breath<br />
Thrills the world untouched of death.<br />
Thy dear doctrine showeth me<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34b" id="Page_34b">[34]</a></span>The summer was spent in France; in November they
sailed for Egypt.</p>

<p>"<i>November 27, Egypt.</i> Land early this morning&mdash;a
long flat strip at first visible. Then Arabs in a boat
came on board. Then began a scene of unparalleled
confusion, in the midst of which Cook's Arabian agent
found me and got my baggage&mdash;helping us all through
quietly, and with great saving of trouble.... A drive
to see Pompey's Pillar and obelisk. A walk through
the bazaar. Heat very oppressive. Delightful drive
in the afternoon to the Antonayades garden and villa....
Mr. Antonayades was most hospitable, gave us
great bouquets, and a basket of fruit."</p>

<p>"<i>Cairo.</i> Walked out. A woman swung up and down
in a box is brown-washing the wall of the hotel. She
was drawn up to the top, quite a height, and gradually
let down. Her dress was a dirty blue cotton gown, and
under that a breech-cloth of dirty sackcloth. We
were to have had an audience from the third Princess<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
this afternoon, and were nearly dressed for the palace
when we were informed that the reception would take
place to-morrow, when there will be a general reception,
it being the first day of Bairam. Visit on
donkey-back to the bazaars, and gallop; sunset most
beautiful."</p>

<p>"Up early, and all agog for the palace. I wore my
black velvet and all my [few] diamonds, also a white
bonnet made by Julia McAllister<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and trimmed with
her lace and Miss Irwin's white lilacs. General Stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35b" id="Page_35b">[35]</a></span>
sent his carriage with <i>sais</i> richly dressed. Reception
was at Abdin Palace&mdash;row of black eunuchs outside,
very grimy in aspect. Only women inside&mdash;dresses
of bright pink and yellow satin, of orange silk, blue,
lilac, white satin. Lady in waiting in blue silk and
diamonds. In the hall they made us sit down, and
brought us cigarettes in gilt saucers. We took a whiff,
then went to the lady in waiting who took us into the
room where the three princesses were waiting to receive
us. They shook hands with us and made us sit
down, seating themselves also. First and second Princesses
on a sofa, I at their right in a fauteuil, on my
left the third Princess. First in white brocaded satin,
pattern very bright, pink flowers with green leaves.
Second wore a Worth dress of corn brocade, trimmed
with claret velvet; third in blue silk. All in stupendous
diamonds. Chibouks brought which reached to the
floor. We smoke, I poorly,&mdash;mine was badly lighted,&mdash;an
attendant in satin brought a fresh coal and then
the third Princess told me it was all right. Coffee in
porcelain cups, the stands all studded with diamonds.
Conversation rather awkward. Carried on by myself
and the third Princess, who interpreted to the others.
Where should we go from Cairo? Up the Nile, in January
to Constantinople."</p>

<p>"Achmed took me to see the women dance, in a
house where a wedding is soon to take place. Dancing
done by a one-eyed woman in purple and gold brocade&mdash;house
large, but grimy with dirt and neglect.
Men all in one room, women in another&mdash;several of
them one-eyed, the singer blind&mdash;only instruments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36b" id="Page_36b">[36]</a></span>
the earthenware drum and castanets worn like rings
on the upper joints of the fingers. Arab café&mdash;the
story-teller, the one-stringed violin...."</p>

<p>"To the ball at the Abdin Palace. The girls looked
charmingly. Maud danced all the night. The Khedive<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
made me quite a speech. He is a short, thickset man,
looking about fifty, with grizzled hair and beard. He
wore a fez, Frank dress, and a star on his breast. Tewfik
Pasha, his son and heir, was similarly dressed. Consul
Farman presented me to both of them. The suite
of rooms is very handsome, but this is not the finest of
the Khedive's palaces. Did not get home much before
four in the morning. In the afternoon had visited the
mosque of Sultan Abdul Hassan...."</p>


<p><br />After Cairo came a trip up the Nile, with all its
glories and discomforts. Between marvel and marvel
she read Herodotus and Mariette Bey assiduously.</p>

<p>"<i>Christmas Day.</i> Cool wind. Native <i>reis</i> of the
boat has a brown woollen capote over his blue cotton
gown, the hood drawn over his turban. A Christmas
service. Rev. Mr. Stovin, English, read the lessons for
the day and the litany. We sang 'Nearer, my God, to
Thee,' and 'Hark, the herald angels sing.' It was a
good little time. My thoughts flew back to Theodore
Parker, who loved this [first] hymn, and in whose
'meeting' I first heard it. Upper deck dressed with
palms&mdash;waiters in their best clothes...."</p>

<p>"To-day visited Assiout, where we arrived soon
after ten in the morning. Donkey-ride delightful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37b" id="Page_37b">[37]</a></span>
visit to the bazaar. Two very nice youths found us
out, pupils of the American Mission. One of these
said, 'I also am Christianity.' Christian pupils more
than one hundred. Several Moslem pupils have embraced
Christianity.... This morning had a very
sober season, lying awake before dawn, and thinking
over this extravagant journey, which threatens to
cause me serious embarrassment."</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The last day of a year in which I have enjoyed
many things, wonderful new sights and impressions,
new friends. I have not been able to do much useful
work, but hope to do better work hereafter for what
this year has shown me. Still, I have spoken four times
in public, each time with labor and preparation&mdash;and
have advocated the causes of woman's education, equal
rights and equal laws for men and women. My heart
greatly regrets that I have not done better, during these
twelve months. Must always hope for the new year."</p>

<p>The record of the new year (1879) begins with the
usual aspirations:&mdash;</p>

<p>"May every minute of this year be improved by
me! This is too much to hope, but not too much to
pray for. And I determine this year to pass no day
without actual prayer, the want of which I have felt
during the year just past. Busy all day, writing, washing
handkerchiefs, and reading Herodotus."</p>

<p>On January 2, she "visited Blind School with General
Stone&mdash;Osny Effendi, Principal. Many trades
and handicrafts&mdash;straw matting, boys&mdash;boys and
girls weaving at hand loom&mdash;girls spinning wool and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38b" id="Page_38b">[38]</a></span>
flax, crochet and knitting&mdash;a lesson in geography.
Turning lathe&mdash;bought a cup of rhinoceros horn."</p>

<p>On January 4 she is "sad to leave Egypt&mdash;dear
beautiful country!"</p>

<p>"<i>Jerusalem, January 5.</i> I write in view of the
Mount of Olives, which glows in the softest sunset
light, the pale moon showing high in the sky. Christ
has been here&mdash;here&mdash;has looked with his bodily
eyes on this fair prospect. The thought ought to be
overpowering&mdash;is inconceivable."</p>

<p>"<i>January 9.</i> In the saddle by half past eight in the
morning. Rode two hours, to Bethlehem. Convent&mdash;Catholic.
Children at the school. Boy with a fine head,
Abib. In the afternoon mounted again and rode in
sight of the Dead Sea. Mountains inexpressibly desolate
and grand. Route very rough, and in some places
rather dangerous.... Grotto of the Nativity&mdash;place
of the birth&mdash;manger where the little Christ was laid.
Tomb of St. Jerome. Tombs of two ladies who were
friends of the Saint. Later the plains of Boaz, which
also [is] that where the shepherds heard the angels.
Encamped at Marsaba. Greek convent near by receives
men only. An old monk brought some of the
handiwork of the brethren for sale. I bought a stamp
for flat cakes, curiously cut in wood. We dined luxuriously,
having a saloon tent and an excellent cook....
Good beds, but I lay awake a good deal with visions of
death from the morrow's ride."</p>

<p>"<i>January 10.</i> [In camp in the desert near Jericho.]
'Shoo-fly'<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> waked us at half past five banging on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39b" id="Page_39b">[39]</a></span>
tin pan and singing 'Shoo-fly.' We rose at once and
I felt my terrors subside. Felt that only prayer and
trust in God could carry me through. We were in the
saddle by seven o'clock and began our perilous crossing
of the hills which lead to the Dead Sea. Scenery inexpressibly
grand and desolate. Some frightful bits of
way&mdash;narrow bridle paths up and down very steep
places, in one place a very narrow ridge to cross, with
precipices on either side. I prayed constantly and so
felt uplifted from the abjectness of animal fear. After
a while we began to have glimpses of the Dead Sea,
which is beautifully situated, shut in by high hills,
quite blue in color. After much mental suffering and
bodily fatigue on my part we arrived at the shores of
the sea. Here we rested for half an hour, and I lay
stretched on the sands which were very clean and
warm! Remounted and rode to Jordan. Here, I had
to be assisted by two men [they lifted her bodily out
of the saddle and laid her on the ground] and lay on
my shawl, eating my luncheon in this attitude. Fell
asleep here. Could not stop long enough to touch the
water. We rested in the shade of a clump of bushes,
near the place where the baptism of Christ is supposed
to have taken place. Our cans were filled with water
from this sacred stream, and I picked up a little bit of
hollow reed, the only souvenir I could find. Remounted
and rode to Jericho. Near the banks of the Jordan we
met a storm of locusts, four-winged creatures which
annoyed our horses and flew in our faces. John the
Baptist probably ate such creatures. Afternoon ride
much better as to safety, but very fatiguing. Reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40b" id="Page_40b">[40]</a></span>
Jericho just after sunset, a beautiful camping-ground.
After dinner, a Bedouin dance, very strange and
fierce. Men and women stood in a semicircle, lighted
by a fire of dry thorns. They clapped their hands and
sang, or rather murmured, in a rhythm which changed
from time to time. A chief danced before them, very
gracefully, threatening them with his sword, with
which he played very skilfully. They sometimes went
on their knees as if imploring him to spare them. He
came twice to our tent and waved the sword close to
our heads, saying, '<i>Taih backsheesh</i>.' The dance was
like an Indian war-dance&mdash;the chief made a noise
just like the war-whoop of our Indians. The dance
lasted half an hour. The chief got his backsheesh and
the whole troop departed. Lay down and rested in
peace, knowing that the dangerous part of our journey
was over."</p>

<p>"<i>In Camp in the Desert. January 11.</i> In the saddle
by half past seven. Rode round the site of ancient
Jericho, of which nothing remains but some portions of
the king's highway. Ruins of a caravanserai, which
is said to be the inn where the good Samaritan lodged
his patient. Stopped for rest and luncheon, at Beth&mdash;and
proceeded to Bethany, where we visited the tomb
of Lazarus. I did not go in&mdash;then rode round the
Mount of Olives and round the walls of Jerusalem,
arriving at half past three in the afternoon. I became
very stiff in my knees, could hardly be mounted on my
horse, and suffered much pain from my knee and abrasions
of the skin caused by the saddle. Did not get
down at the tomb of Lazarus because I could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41b" id="Page_41b">[41]</a></span>
descended the steps which led to it, and could not have
got on my horse again. When we reached our hotel,
I could not step without help, and my strength was
quite exhausted. I say to all tourists, avoid Cook's
dreadful hurry, and to all women, avoid Marsaba!
This last day, we often met little troops of Bedouins
travelling on donkeys&mdash;sometimes carrying with
them their cattle and household goods. I saw a beautiful
white and black lamb carried on a donkey. Met
three Bedouin horsemen with long spears. One of
these stretched his spear across the way almost touching
my face, for a joke."</p>

<p>"<i>Jerusalem. Sunday, January 12.</i> English service.
Communion, interesting here where the rite was instituted.
I was very thankful for this interesting
opportunity."</p>

<p>"<i>January 15.</i> Mission hospital and schools in the
morning. Also Saladin's horse. Wailing place of the
Jews and some ancient synagogues. In the afternoon
walked to Gethsemane and ascended the Mount of
Olives. In the first-named place, sang one verse of our
hymn, 'Go to dark Gethsemane.' Got some flowers
and olive leaves...."</p>


<p><br />After Jerusalem came Jaffa, where she delivered an
address to a "circle" at a private house. She says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Jaffa of the Crusaders, Joppa of Peter and Paul,
I find an American Mission School, kept by a worthy
lady from Rhode Island. Prominent among its points
of discipline is the clean-washed face, which is so enthroned
in the prejudices of Western civilization. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42b" id="Page_42b">[42]</a></span>
of her scholars, a youth of unusual intelligence, finding
himself clean, observes himself to be in strong contrast
with his mother's hovel, in which filth is just kept
clear of fever point. 'Why this dirt?' quoth he; 'that
which has made me clean will cleanse this also.' So
without more ado, the process of scrubbing is applied
to the floor, without regard to the danger of so great
a novelty. This simple fact has its own significance,
for if the innovation of soap and water can find its
way to a Jaffa hut, where can the ancient, respectable,
conservative dirt-devil feel himself secure?"</p>

<p>Apropos of mission work (in which she was a firm
believer), she loved to tell how one day in Jerusalem
she was surrounded by a mob of beggars, unwashed
and unsavory, clamoring for money, till she was well-nigh
bewildered. Suddenly there appeared a beautiful
youth in spotless white, who scattered the mob, took
her horse's bridle, and in good English offered to lead
her to her hotel. It was as if an angel had stepped into
the narrow street.</p>

<p>"Who are you, dear youth?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I am a Christian!" was the reply.</p>

<p>In parting she says, "Farewell, Holy Land!
Thank God that I have seen and felt it! All good come
to it!"</p>


<p><br />From Palestine the way led to Cyprus ("the town
very muddy and bare of all interest") and Smyrna,
thence to Constantinople. Here she visited Robert
College with great delight. Returning, she saw the
"Sultan going to Friday's prayers. A melancholy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43b" id="Page_43b">[43]</a></span>
frightened-looking man, pale, with a large, face-absorbing
nose...."</p>


<p><br />"<i>February 3.</i> Early at Piræus. Kalopothakis<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> met
us there, coming on board.... To Athens by carriage.
Acropolis as beautiful as ever. It looks small after the
Egyptian temples, and of course more modern&mdash;still
very impressive...."</p>

<p>Athens, with its welcoming faces of friends, seemed
almost homelike after the Eastern journeyings. The
Journal tells of sight-seeing for the benefit of the
younger traveller, and of other things beside.</p>

<p>"Called on the <i>Grande Maîtresse</i> at the Palace in
order to have cards for the ball. Saw the Schliemann
relics from Mycenæ, and the wonderful marbles gathered
in the Museum. Have been writing something
about these. To ball at the palace in my usual sober
rig, black velvet and so forth. Queen very gracious to
us.... Home by three in the morning."</p>

<p>"<i>February 12.</i> At ten in the morning came a committee
of Cretan officers of the late insurrection, presenting
a letter through Mr. Rainieri, himself a Cretan,
expressing the gratitude of the Cretans to dear Papa
for his efforts in their behalf.... Mr. Rainieri made
a suitable address in French&mdash;to which I replied in
the same tongue. Coffee and cordial were served. The
occasion was of great interest.... In the afternoon
spoke at Mrs. Felton's of the Advancement of Women
as promoted by association. An American dinner of
perhaps forty, nearly all women, Greek, but understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44b" id="Page_44b">[44]</a></span>
English. A good occasion. To party at
Madame Schliemann's."</p>

<p>"<i>February 15.</i> Miserable with a cold. A confused day
in which nothing seemed to go right. Kept losing sight
of papers and other things. Felt as if God could not
have made so bad a day&mdash;my day after all; I made it."</p>

<p>"<i>February 18.</i> To ball at the Palace. King took
Maud out in the German."</p>

<p>"<i>February 21.</i> The day for eating the roast lamb
with the Cretan chiefs. Went down to the Piræus
warmly wrapped up.... Occasion most interesting.
Much speech-making and toasting. I mentioned
Felton."</p>

<p>"<i>February 22.</i> Dreadful day of departure. Packed
steadily but with constant interruptions. The Cretans
called upon me to present their photographs and take
leave. Tried a poem, failed. Had black coffee&mdash;tried
another&mdash;succeeded...."</p>

<p>"<i>February 23.</i> Sir Henry Layard, late English minister
to the Porte, is on board. Talked Greek at dinner&mdash;beautiful
evening&mdash;night as rough as it could well
be. Little sleep for any of us. Glad to see that Lord
Hartington has spoken in favor of the Greeks, censuring
the English Government."</p>

<p>"<i>February 26....</i> Sir Henry Layard and I <i>tête-à-tête</i>
on deck, looking at the prospect&mdash;he coveting it,
no doubt, for his rapacious country, I coveting it for
liberty and true civilization."</p>


<p><br />The spring was spent in Italy. In May they came
to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45b" id="Page_45b">[45]</a></span>"<i>May 29.</i> Met Mr. William Speare.... He told
me of his son's death, and of that of William Lloyd
Garrison. Gallant old man, unique and enviable in
reputation and character. Who, oh! who can take his
place? 'Show us the Father.'"</p>


<p><br />The last weeks of the London visit were again too
full for any adequate account of them to find its way
into her letters or journals. She visited London once
more in later years, but this was her last long stay. She
never forgot the friends she made there, and it was
one of the many day-dreams she enjoyed that she
should return for another London season. Sometimes
after reading the account of the gay doings chronicled
in the London "World," which Edmund Yates sent her
as long as he lived, she would cry out, "O! for a whiff
of London!" or, "My dear, we must have another
London season before I die!"</p>

</p>


<p><br />July, 1879, found our mother at home at Oak Glen,
unpacking trunks and reading a book on the Talmud.
She had met the three married daughters in Boston
("We talked incessantly for seven hours," says the
Journal), and Florence and Maud accompanied her to
Newport, where Florence had established her summer
nursery. There were three Hall grandchildren now, and
they became an important factor in the life at Oak
Glen. All through the records of these summer days
runs the patter of children's feet.</p>

<p>She kept only one corner of the house for her private
use; a room with the north light which she then
thought essential. This was at once bedroom and
workroom: she never had a separate study or library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47b" id="Page_47b">[47]</a></span>
Here, as in Green Peace days, she worked quietly and
steadily. Children and grandchildren might fill the
house, might have everything it contained: she asked
only for her "precious time." When she could not
have an hour she took half an hour, a quarter, ten
minutes. No fragment of time was too small for her
to save, to invest in study or in work; and as her
mind concentrated instantly on the subject in hand,
no such fragment was wasted. The rule of mind over
body was relentless: sick or well, she must finish her
stint before the day closed.</p>

<p>This summer of 1879 was a happy one. After the
feverish months of travel and pleasure, her delight in
the soft Newport climate was deeper than ever. She
always felt the change from the air of the mainland
to that of the island, and never crossed the bridge from
Tiverton to Bristol Ferry without an exclamation of
pleasure. She used to say that the soft, cool air of Newport
smoothed out the tired, tangled nerves "like a

<p><br />"<i>July 29.</i> To my Club, where, better than any
ovation, an affectionate greeting awaited me....
Thucydides is very difficult."</p>

<p>This was the Town and Country Club, for some
years a great interest to her. In her "Reminiscences"
she tells how in a summer of the late sixties or early
seventies, when Bret Harte and Dr. J. G. Holland,
Professors Lane and Goodwin of Harvard were spending
the season at Newport: "A little band of us combined
to improve the beautiful summer season by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48b" id="Page_48b">[48]</a></span>
picnics, sailing parties, and household soirées, in all of
which these brilliant literary lights took part. Helen
Hunt and Kate Field were often of our company, and
Colonel Higginson was always with us."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Among the frolics of that summer was the mock
Commencement, arranged by her and Professor Lane.</p>

<p>"I acted as President, Colonel Higginson as my
aide; we both marched up the aisle in Oxford caps and
gowns. I opened the proceedings by an address in
Latin, Greek, and English; and when I turned to Colonel
Higginson and called him '<i>fili mihi dilectissime</i>,'
he wickedly replied with three bows of such comic
gravity that I almost gave way to unbecoming laughter.
Not long before this he had published a paper on
the Greek goddesses. I therefore assigned as his theme
the problem, 'How to sacrifice an Irish bull to a Greek
goddess.' Colonel George Waring, the well-known
engineer, being at that time in charge of a valuable
farm in the neighborhood, was invited to discuss
'Social small potatoes: how to enlarge their eyes.' An
essay on rhinoscopy was given by Fanny Fern, the
which I, chalk in hand, illustrated on the blackboard
by the following equation:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Nose + nose + nose = proboscis.<br />
Nose - nose - nose = snub.<br />
</p>

<p>"A class was called upon for recitations from Mother
Goose in seven different languages. At the head of this
Professor Goodwin honored us with a Greek version
of the 'Man in the Moon.' A recent Harvard graduate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49b" id="Page_49b">[49]</a></span>
Dr. Gorham Bacon, recited the following, also of her
composition:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'Heu iterum didulum,<br />
Felis cum fidulum,<br />
Vacca transiluit lunam,<br />
Caniculus ridet,<br />
Quum tale videt,<br />
Et dish ambulavit cum spoonam.'<br />
</p>

<p>"The question being asked whether this last line was
in strict accordance with grammar, the scholar gave
the following rule: 'The conditions of grammar should
always give way to the exigencies of rhyme.'</p>

<p>"The delicious fooling of that unique summer was
never repeated. Out of it came, however, the more
serious and permanent association known as the Town
and Country Club of Newport. I felt the need of upholding
the higher social ideals and of not leaving true
culture unrepresented, even in a summer watering-place."</p>

<p>With the help and advice of Professor and Mrs. William
B. Rogers, Colonel Higginson and Mr. Samuel
Powell, a number of friends were called together in the
early summer of 1874 and she laid before them the plan
of the proposed club. After speaking of the growing
predominance of the gay and fashionable element in
Newport society, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But some things can be done as well as others.
Newport ... has also treasures which are still unexplored....</p>

<p>"The milliner and the mantua-maker bring here
their costly goods and tempt the eye with forms and
colors. But the great artist, Nature, has here merchandise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50b" id="Page_50b">[50]</a></span>
far more precious, whose value and beauty
are understood by few of us. I remember once meeting
a philosopher in a jeweller's shop. The master of
the establishment exhibited to us his choicest wares,
among others a costly diamond ornament. The philosopher
[we think it was Emerson] said, 'A violet is more
beautiful.' I cannot forget the disgust expressed in the
jeweller's face at this remark."</p>

<p>She then outlined the course laid out by the "Friends
in Council," lectures on astronomy, botany, natural
history, all by eminent persons. They would not expect
the Club to meet them on their own ground. They
would come to that of their hearers, and would unfold
to them what they were able to understand.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Weir Mitchell discoursed to them on
the Poison of Serpents, John La Farge on the South
Sea Islands, Alexander Agassiz on Deep-Sea Dredging
and the Panama Canal; while Mark Twain and
"Hans Breitmann" made merry, each in his own
inimitable fashion.</p>

<p>The Town and Country Club had a long and happy
career. No matter what heavy work she might have
on hand for the summer, no sooner arrived at Newport
than our mother called together her Governing Committee
and planned out the season's meetings.</p>

<p>It may have been for this Club that she wrote her
"Parlor Macbeth," an extravaganza in which she appeared
as "the impersonation of the whole Macbeth
family."</p>

<p>In the prologue she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As it is often said and supposed that a woman is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51b" id="Page_51b">[51]</a></span>
the bottom of all the mischief that is done under the
sun, I appear and say that I am she, that woman, the
female fate of the Macbeth family."</p>

<p>In the monologue that follows, Lady Macbeth
fairly lives before the audience, and in amazing travesty
relates the course of the drama.</p>

<p>She thus describes the visit of the weird sisters (the
three Misses Macbeth) who have been asked to contribute
some of "their excellent hell-broth and devilled
articles" for her party.</p>

<p>"At 12 <span class="smcap">m.</span>, a rushing and bustling was heard, and
down the kitchen chimney tumbled the three weird
sisters, finding everything ready for their midnight
operations.... 'That hussy of a Macbeth's wife leaves
us nothing to work with,' cried one. 'She makes double
trouble for us.' 'Double trouble, double trouble,'
they all cried and groaned in chorus, and presently fell
into a sort of trilogy of mingled prose and verse which
was enough to drive one mad.</p>

<p>
'Where hast thou been?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Sticking pigs.</span><br />
And where hast thou?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Why, curling wigs</span><br />
Fit for a shake in German jigs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And hoo! carew! carew!'</span><br />

<p>"'We must have Hecate now, can't do without her.
Throw the beans over the broomstick and say boo!'
And lo, Hecate comes, much like the others, only
rather more so....</p>

<p>"Now they began to work in good earnest. And
they had brought with them whole bottles of <i>sunophon</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52b" id="Page_52b">[52]</a></span>
and <i>sozodont</i>, and <i>rypophagon</i>, and <i>hyperbolism</i>
and <i>consternaculum</i>, and a few others. And in the
whole went. And one stirred the great pot over the
fire, while the others danced around and sang&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'Black pepper and red,<br />
White pepper and grey,<br />
Tingle, tingle, tingle, tingle,<br />
Till it smarts all day.'<br />
</p>

<p>"'Here's dyspepsia! Here's your racking headache
of a morning. Here's podagra, and jaundice, and a few
fits. And now it's done to a turn, and the weird sisters
have done what they could for the family.'</p>

<p>"A rumbling and tumbling and foaming was now
heard in the chimney&mdash;the bricks opened, and He-cat
and She-cat and all the rest of them went up. And I
knew that my supper would be first-rate."</p>


<p><br />The time came when some of the other officers of
the Town and Country Club felt unable to keep the
pace set by her. She would still press forward, but
they hung back, feeling the burden of the advancing
years which sat so lightly on her shoulders. The Club
was disbanded; its fund of one thousand dollars, so
honorably earned, was given to the Redwood Library,
one of the old institutions of Newport.</p>

<p>The Town and Country Club was succeeded by the
Papéterie, a smaller club of ladies only, more intimate
in its character. The exchange of "paper novels"
furnished its name and its <i>raison d'être</i>. The members
were expected to describe the books taken home from
the previous meeting. "What have you to tell us of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53b" id="Page_53b">[53]</a></span>
the novel you have been reading?" the president would
demand. Then followed a report, serious or comic, as
the character of the volume or the mood of the meeting
suggested. A series of abbreviated criticisms was made
and a glossary prepared: for example,&mdash;</p>

<p>
"B. P.&mdash;By the pound.<br />
M. A. S.&mdash;May amuse somebody.<br />
P. B.&mdash;Pot-boiler.<br />
F. W. B.&mdash;For waste-basket.<br />
U. I.&mdash;Uplifting influence.<br />
W. D.&mdash;Wholly delightful.<br />
U. T.&mdash;Utter trash."<br />
</p>

<p>The officers consisted of the Glossarian, the Penologist,
whose duty it was to invent penalties for delinquents,
the Cor. Sec. and the Rec. Sec. (corresponding
and recording secretaries) and the Archivist, who had
charge of the archives. During its early years a novel
was written by the Club, each member writing one
chapter. It still exists, and part of the initiation of a
new member consists in reading the manuscript. The
"delicious fooling" that marked the first year of the
Town and Country Club's existence was the animating
spirit of the Papéterie. A friend christened it "Mrs.
Howe's Vaudeville." Merrymaking was her safety-valve.
Brain fag and nervous prostration were practically
unknown to her. When she had worked to the
point of exhaustion, she turned to play. Fun and frolic
went along with labor and prayer; the power of combining
these kept her steadily at her task till the end
of her life. The last time she left her house, six days
before her death, it was to preside at the Papéterie,
where she was as usual the life of the meeting! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54b" id="Page_54b">[54]</a></span>
Club still lives, and, like the New England Woman's
Club, seems still pervaded by her spirit.</p>

<p>The Clubs did not have all the fun. The Newport
"Evening Express" of September 2, 1881, says: "Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe has astonished Newport by her acting
in 'False Colors.' But she always was a surprising
woman."</p>

<p>Another newspaper says: "The interest of the Newport
world has been divided this week between the
amateur theatricals at the Casino and the lawn tennis
tournament. Two representations of the comedy of
'False Colors' were given on Tuesday and Wednesday
evenings.... The stars were undoubtedly Mrs. Julia
Ward Howe and Mr. Peter Marié, who brought down
the house by their brightness and originality.... Mr.
Peter Marié gave a supper on the last night of the performance,
during which he proposed the health of Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe and the thanks of the company for
her valuable assistance. Mrs. Howe's reply was very
bright and apt, and her playful warnings of the dangers
of sailing under false colors were fully appreciated."</p>

<p>It is remembered that of all the gay company she
was the only one who was letter-perfect in her part.</p>


<p><br />To return to 1879. She preached many times this
summer in and around Newport.</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday, September 28.</i> Hard at work. Could not
look at my sermon until this day. Corrected my reply
to Parkman.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Had a very large audience for the place&mdash;all
seats full and benches put in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55b" id="Page_55b">[55]</a></span>"My sermon at the Unitarian Church in Newport.
A most unexpected crowd to hear me."</p>

<p>"<i>September 29.</i> Busy with preparing the dialogue
in 'Alice in Wonderland' for the Town and Country
Club occasion...."</p>


<p><br />Many entries begin with "hard at work," or "very
busy all day."</p>

<p>This summer was made delightful by a visit from
her sister Louisa, with her husband<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and daughter.
Music formed a large part of the summer's pleasure.
The Journal tells of a visit from Timothée Adamowski
which was greatly enjoyed.</p>

<p>"<i>October 11.</i> Much delightful music. Adamowski
has made a pleasant impression upon all of us."</p>

<p>"<i>October 12, Sunday.</i> Sorry to say we made music all
day. Looked hard for Uncle Sam, who came not."</p>

<p>"<i>October 13.</i> Our delightful matinée. Adamowski
and Daisy played finely, he making a great sensation.
I had the pleasure of accompanying Adamowski in a
Nocturne of Chopin's for violin and piano. All went
well. Our pleasure and fatigue were both great. The
house looked charming."</p>


<p><br />In the autumn came a lecture tour, designed to recoup
the heavy expenses of the Eastern trip. Never
skilful in matters of money-making, this tour was
undertaken with less preparation than the modern
lecturer could well imagine. She corresponded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56b" id="Page_56b">[56]</a></span>
one and another Unitarian clergyman and arranged her
lectures largely through them. Though she did not
bring back so much money as many less popular
speakers, she was, after all, her own mistress, and was
not rushed through the country like a letter by ambitious
managers.</p>

<p>The Journal gives some glimpses of this trip.</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes to dress, sup, and get to the hall.
Swallowed a cup of tea and nibbled a biscuit as I
dressed myself."</p>

<p>"Found the miserablest railroad hotel, where I
waited all day for trunk, in distress!... Had to lecture
without either dress or manuscript. Mrs. Blank
hastily arrayed me in her black silk, and I had fortunately
a few notes."</p>

<p>She never forgot this lesson, and in all the thirty-odd
years of speaking and lecturing that remained,
made it an invariable rule to travel with her lecture and
her cap and laces in her handbag. As she grew older,
the satchel grew lighter. She disliked all personal service,
and always wanted to carry her hand-luggage herself.
The light palm-leaf knapsack she brought from
Santo Domingo was at the end replaced by a net, the
lightest thing she could find.</p>


<p><br />The Unitarian Church in Newport was second in her
heart only to the Church of the Disciples. The Reverend
Charles T. Brooks, the pastor, was her dear
friend. In the spring of 1880 a Channing memorial
celebration was held in Newport, for which she wrote
a poem. She sat on the platform near Mr. Emerson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57b" id="Page_57b">[57]</a></span>
heard Dr. Bellows's discourse on Channing, "which
was exhaustive, and as it lasted two hours, exhausting."
The exercises, W. H. Channing's eulogium, etc.,
etc., lasted through the day and evening, and in the
intervals between addresses she was "still retouching"
her poem, which came last of all. "A great day!" says
the Journal.</p>


<p><br />"<i>July 23.</i> Very busy all day. Rainy weather. In the
evening I had a mock meeting, with burlesque papers,
etc. I lectured on <i>Ism-Is-not-m</i>, on <i>Asm-spasm-plasm</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>July 24.</i> Working hard, as usual. Marionettes at
home in the evening. Laura had written the text. Maud
was Julius Cæsar; Flossy, Cassius; Daisy, Brutus."</p>

<p>"<i>July 28.</i> Read my lecture on 'Modern Society' in
the Hillside Chapel at Concord.... The comments of
Messrs. Alcott and W. H. Channing were quite enough
to turn a sober head."</p>

<p>"To the poorhouse and to Jacob Chase's with Joseph
Coggeshall. Old Elsteth, whom I remember these many
years, died a few weeks ago. One of the pauper women
who has been there a long time told me that Elsteth
cried out that she was going to Heaven, and that she
gave her, as a last gift, a red handkerchief. Mrs. Anna
Brown, whom I saw last year, died recently. Her relatives
are people in good position and ought to have
provided for her in her declining years. They came, in
force, to her funeral and had a very nice coffin for her.
Took her body away for burial. Such meanness needs
no comment.</p>

<p>"Jacob was glad to see me. Asked after Maud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58b" id="Page_58b">[58]</a></span>
doubted whether she was as handsome as I was when
he first saw me (thirty or more years ago). His wife
said to me in those days: 'Jacob thinks thee's the only
good-looking woman in these parts.' She was herself
a handsome woman and a very sweet one. I wish I had
known I was so good-looking."</p>


<p><br />Of the writing of letters there was no end. Correspondence
was rather a burden than a delight to her;
yet, when all the "duty letters" were written, she
loved to take a fresh sheet and frolic with some one
of her absent children. Laura, being the furthest removed,
received perhaps more than her share of these
letters; yet, as will appear from them, she never had
enough.</p>

<p>How I wonder how you R! Cause of silence not
hardness of heart, but the given necessity of scribbling
for dear life, to finish a promised paper for the Woman's
Congress, <i>sedebit</i> next week. I in Boston Wed., Thurs.,
and Fri.&mdash;day being understood. Mowski [Adamowski]
left us yesterday morning.... We had him
here a fortnight, and enjoyed his visit extremely. At
table, between the courses, he played on every instrument
of the orchestra. I asked once for the bass drum,
which he imitated, adding thereunto the cymbals.
We had a lunch party last week, for the bride, Maud
Appleton, and "invited quite fashionable," and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59b" id="Page_59b">[59]</a></span>
all she didn't come. "Sick in bed with diphtheria."
May by some be considered an excuse, but then,
it's very rude to be sick, and it's very troublesome
to other people. (This to make you feel badly about
your own shortcomings.) We had a little dance,
too, on Friday evening. An omnibus party came out
and a few others. I pounded the Lancers and some
ancient waltzes and polkas, ending with the Virginia
reel, in which last I thought my floor would give way,
the young men stamped so. I have no paper left
except some newspaper wrappers, so can't write any
more. Got up and found this scrap, then hunted for
my pen, which, after some search, I found in my mouth.
This is what it is to be lit'ry. Oh, my! I sometimes
wish I wasn't!...</p></blockquote>


<p><br />In October, while visiting Julia at the Institution,
she missed her footing and fell down the two steps leading
to the dining-room, breaking the ligaments of her
knee. A letter to Laura makes the first mention of this
serious accident, whose effects she felt all her life.</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Laura Child</span>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Behold the mum-jacket, sitting clothed and in her
chair, confronting you after long silence, with comforting
words of recovery. I am now in the fourth week
of my infirmity, and I really think that the offending,
or rather offended, muscles have almost recovered
their natural power of contraction. My exercise is
still restricted to a daily walk from my bed in the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60b" id="Page_60b">[60]</a></span>
parlor to my chair in the large parlor, and back again.
But this walk, which at first was an impotent limp,
with bones clicking loosely, is now a very respectable
performance, not on the tight rope, indeed, but, let us
say, on the tight garter.... The only break in the
general uniformity of my life was dear Uncle Sam's
arrival on Sunday last. He remained with us a couple
of hours, and was as delightful as ever. Oh! more news.
With his kind help, I have taken Mrs. Lodge's small
house for the winter and this opens to me a comfortable
prospect, though, even with his help, the two
ends will have to be pulled a little in order to meet....</p></blockquote>


<p><br />The furnished house in lower Mount Vernon Street
proved a pleasant habitat. It was nine years since she
had had a house in Boston; in spite of her lameness,
perhaps partly because of it, she enjoyed entertaining
her family and friends. Mrs. Terry and her daughter
spent part of the winter with them.</p>

<p>The year 1880 was marked by the publication of her
first book since "Later Lyrics": a tiny volume entitled
"Modern Society," containing, beside the title
essay, a kindred one on "Changes in American Society."
The Journal makes little or no mention of this
booklet, but Thomas Wentworth Higginson says of
it: "It would be hard to find a book in American literature
better worth reprinting and distributing.... In
wit, in wisdom, in anecdote, I know few books so racy."</p>


<p><br />"<i>January 1, 1881.</i> I have now been lame for twelve
weeks, in consequence of a bad fall which I had on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61b" id="Page_61b">[61]</a></span>
October 17. I am still on crutches with my left knee
in a splint. Have had much valuable leisure in consequence
of this, but have suffered much inconvenience
and privation of preaching, social intercourse, etc.
Very little pain since the first ten days. Farewell, Old
Year! Thank the Heavenly Father for many joys,
comforts and opportunities."</p>

<p>Her physician insisted upon her keeping quiet, but
she could not obey him, and continued to travel about
on crutches to keep her many engagements. Her faithful
coachman, Frank McCarthy, was her companion
on these journeys.</p>

<p>"<i>January 26.</i> Busy most of the day with my lecture.
Had a visit from H. P. B.,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> who advised me to
keep still and go nowhere until my lameness shall be
much better. Took 4.30 train for Concord, Massachusetts.
Maud would go with me, which grieved me,
as she thereby lost a brilliant ball.... We went to
Mr. Cheney's, where we found Frank Barlow, a little
older, but quite unchanged as to character, etc. He
has the endearing coquetry of a woman. Dear Mr.
Emerson and Mrs. came to my lecture. Mr. E. said
that he liked it. The audience was very attentive
throughout. Stepped only once on my lame foot in
getting into the sleigh...."</p>

<p>"<i>January 28.</i> Busy all day with my address for
woman's suffrage meeting in the evening.... When
I entered with my crutches the audience applauded
quite generally.... Wendell Phillips made the concluding
speech of the evening. He was less brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62b" id="Page_62b">[62]</a></span>
than usual, and kept referring to what I had said. I
thanked him for this afterwards, and he said that my
speech had spoiled his own; that I had taken up the
very points upon which he had intended to dwell."</p>

<p>"<i>February 11.</i> Lecture at Groton, Massachusetts.
As I went down the steps to the carriage, one of my
crutches slipped and the careless hackman on my right
let me fall, Frank catching me, but not until I had given
my knee a severe wrench which gave me great pain.
I suffered much in my travel, but got through, Frank
helping me.... My knee seemed much inflamed and
kept me awake much of the night. My lecture on
'Polite Society' was well received. The good people
of the house brought me their new ledger, that my
name might be the first recorded in it."</p>

<p>"<i>February 12.</i> Dinner of Merchants' Club. Edward
Atkinson invites me. Got back by early train,
7.50 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, feeling poorly. Did not let Maud know of
my hurt. Went to the dinner mentioned above, which
was at the Vendôme.... Was taken in to dinner by
the President, Mr. Fitz. Robert Collyer had the place
on my right. He was delightful as ever. Edward
Everett Hale sat near me and talked with me from
time to time. Of course my speech afflicted me. I got
through it, however, but had to lose the other speeches,
the hour being so late and the night so inclement, very
rainy."</p>

<p>"<i>February 20.</i> Very lame this morning. No courage

<p>The March wind blows, and gives me the spleen.
I don't care about anything, don't want my books,
nor my friends, nor nothing. But you, poor child, may
not be in this wicked, not caring condition, and so I
will write you, having oughted to for a considerable
time. Nothing stays put, not even put-ty. Letters
don't stay answered, faces don't stay washed, clothes
don't stay either clean or new. Children won't stay
the youngest. The world won't stay anywhere, anyhow.
Forty years ago was good enough for me. Why
couldn't it stay? Now, I see you undertaking to comfort
me in good earnest, and know just how you would
begin by saying: "Well, it should!"... Nunc Richard<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
here yesterday. Remarked nothing in particular, I replying
in like manner. Kept his arm very dark, under
a sort of cloak. We condoled [with] each other upon
our mental stupidity, and parted with no particular
views or sentiments. I have been to-day at a worldly
fashionable lunch. Nobody cared for anything but
what they had on and had to eat. "He! he!" said one:
"ho! ho! ho!" the other. "Is your uncle dead yet?"
"No, but my aunt is." "Grandfather Wobblestick used
to say"&mdash;"Why, of course he did!" Which is all that
I remember of the conversation. Now, darling, this is
perfectly hateful of me to turn and snarl at the hand
which has just been putting good morsels into my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65b" id="Page_65b">[65]</a></span>
mouth. But you see, this is a March wind in Boston,
and I can't help it. And I hobbled greatly up the big
staircase, also down. That's all. Auntie and Daisy
and Maud lunched, too, munchingly. D. made a new
capote for Maud. Nobody made nothing new for me.
I had no lace bow under my chin, and looked so neglected!
Maud and Daisy always on the wing, concerts,
theatres, lunches, etc., etc. Auntie and I have
some good evenings at home, in which we refresh the
venerable intelligence with the modern publication,
we do, to wit, "Early Life of Charles James Fox." We
also play Russian backgammon. Big Frank Crawford
has enlargement of 's liver. This P.M. late Mrs. C. C.
Perkins has recep. for Miss Carl Schurz. Girls going,
but going first to X.'s weekly weak tea and weaker
talk. Here again, you spleeny devil, get thee behind
me! I love my fellow-creatures, but, bless you, not in
this month.... Julia Nagnos takes tea round generally,
and finds that it agrees with her.... I regard
you, on the whole, with feeling. Farewell, Laura, I am
your poor old mad March hare Mamma. Love to
Skip and the little ones.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bad old party, is and was. Badness mostly of
heart, though head has a decided crack in it. Unfeeling
old Beast! Left Laura so long without a word.
Guess 't isn't worth while for her to write anything
more.</p>

<p>My poor dear little Laura, how miserably you must
have been feeling, I know well by your long silence.
Oh! posterity! posterity! how much you cost, and how
little you come to! Did I not cost as much as another?
And what do I come to? By Jingo!</p>

<p>Darling, I have got some little miserable mean excuses.
Want 'em? Have had much writing to do,
many words for little money. For "Critic" (N.Y.)
and for "Youth's Companion" and other things.
Then, have kept up great correspondence with Uncle
Sam, who has given me a house in Beacon Street! <i>oh

Maud thought it frumpy, but others liked it very
much. Have been to church to-day, heard J. F. C.
'Most off crutches now and hobble about the house
with a cane. Use crutches to go up and down stairs
and to walk in the street.... Have heard much music
and have seen Salvini once, in the "Gladiator," and

<p><br />"<i>May 27.</i> Soon after 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> arrived Uncle Sam with
my dear sister Annie Mailliard from California; the
whole intended as a birthday surprise. My sister is
very little changed; always a most tender, sensitive
woman. Sister Louisa didn't know of this and came
at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to bring my greetings and gifts, with Mr.
Terry, Daisy, and Uncle Sam. When Sister Annie
appeared, Sister Louisa almost fainted with delight
and astonishment."</p>

all day. Her child, a fine boy, born at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
We are all very happy and thankful. It was touching
to see the surprise and joy of the little children when
they were admitted to a sight of their new relative.
There was something reverent in the aspect of the
little creatures, as if they partly felt the mystery of
this new life which they could not understand. Some
one told them that it came from Heaven. Harry, four
years old, said: 'No, it didn't come from Heaven, for
it hasn't any wings.'"</p>

<p>Yes, she was a little injured, but not so bad as she

all my lit'ry work, which seems to be heaviest in
summer time, I had an awful deal to do in taking care
of Flossy's children and the new baby. The babe is of
the crying sort! When anything is to be done for his
Ma, the nurse expects some one to hold him.... I
returned last night from a journey to Vermont, where
I read a paper before the American Institute of Education,
and also spoke at a suffrage meeting and also at
an outdoor mass meeting, and also at a suffrage meeting
in Montpelier, and came back, after four days'
absence, very tired. (Chorus, Don't tell Maud.)...</p></blockquote>


<p><br />"<i>August 30.</i> My first performance at the Casino
Theatre. It went off very successfully, and I was much
applauded, as were most of the others. Supper afterwards
at Mrs. Richard Hunt's, where I had to appear
in 'plain clothes,' having been unable to accomplish
evening dress after the play. Dear Flossy went
with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69b" id="Page_69b">[69]</a></span>Another "performance" of that summer is not noted
in the Journal; an impromptu rendering of "Horatius
at the Bridge," in the "green parlor" at Oak Glen,
with the following cast:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Horatius  &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;        F. Marion Crawford.<br />
Spurius Lartius    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    J. W. H.<br />
Herminius       &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Maud Howe.<br />
</p>

<p>The green parlor was an oval grass plot, thickly
screened by tall cedars. Laura recited the ballad,
keeping her voice as she could while the heroes waged
desperate combat, but breaking down entirely when
Horatius "plunged headlong in the tide," and swam
with magnificent action across&mdash;the greensward!</p>

<p><br />"<i>January 29, 1882.</i> Frank [Marion Crawford] had
met Oscar Wilde the evening before at Dr. Chadwick's;
said that he expressed a desire to make my acquaintance.
Wrote before I went to church to invite him to
lunch. He accepted and Maud and Frank, or rather
Marion, flew about to get together friends and viands.
Returning from a lifting and delightful sermon of
J. F. C.'s, I met Maud at the door. She cried: 'Oscar
is coming.' Mrs. Jack Gardner, Madame Braggiotti,
and Julia completed our lunch party. Perhaps ten or
twelve friends came after lunch. We had what I might
call a 'lovely toss-up,' <i>i.e.</i>, a social dish quickly compounded
and tossed up like an omelet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71b" id="Page_71b">[71]</a></span>During this year and the next, Crawford made his
home at 241 Beacon Street. Here he wrote his first
three books, "Mr. Isaacs," "Dr. Claudius," and "A
Roman Singer." He was a delightful inmate, and the
months he spent under our mother's roof were happy
ones. A tender <i>camaraderie</i> existed between aunt
and nephew. During his first winter in Boston he
thought of going on the stage as a singer, and studied
singing with Georg Henschel. He had a fine voice, a
dramatic manner, full of fire, but an imperfect ear.
This fault Henschel at first thought could be remedied:
for months they labored together, trying to overcome
it. Crawford delighted in singing, and "Auntie" in
playing his accompaniments. At dusk the two would
repair to the old Chickering grand to make music&mdash;Schubert,
Brahms, and arias from the oratorios they
both loved. In the evening the three guitars would be
brought out, and aunt and nephew, with Maud or
Brother Harry, would sing and play German students'
songs, or the folk-songs of Italy, Ireland, and Scotland.
Our mother was sure to be asked for Matthias Claudius's
"<i>Als Noah aus dem Kasten war</i>": Crawford would
respond with "<i>Im schwarzen Wallfisch zu Ascalon</i>."</p>

<p>This was the first of thirty happy years passed at
241 Beacon Street, the house Uncle Sam bought for
her. The day she moved in, a friend asked her the
number of her new house.</p>

<p>"241," she answered. "You can remember it because
I'm the two-forty one."</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde was at this time making a lecture tour
through the United States. This was the heyday of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72b" id="Page_72b">[72]</a></span>
his popularity; he had been heralded as the apostle
of the æsthetic movement. At his first lecture, given
at the old Boston Music Hall, he appeared in a black
velvet court suit with ruffles, and black silk stockings,
his hair long and curling on his shoulders. A few moments
after he had taken his place on the platform, a
string of Harvard students filed into the hall, dressed
in caricature of the lecturer's costume, each with a sunflower
in his coat and a peacock feather in his hand.
Our mother, who was in the audience, recognized near
the head of the procession her favorite grand-nephew,
Winthrop Chanler. Wilde took this interruption in
good part, welcoming the lads and turning the laugh
against them. "Imitation is the sincerest flattery,"
he said, "though this is a case where I might say,
'Save me from my friends.'"</p>

<p>Wilde came several times to the house in Boston;
later Uncle Sam brought him to spend a day or two
at Oak Glen, where the household was thrown into a
flutter by the advent of his valet. It was one thing to
entertain the æsthete, another to put up the gentleman's
gentleman. In spite of all the affectation of
the æsthetic pose, Wilde proved a rarely entertaining
guest. He talked amazingly well; in that company
all that was best in the man came to the surface.
He recited his noble poem, "The Ode to Albion,"
under the trees of Oak Glen, and told endless stories
of Swinburne, Whistler, and other celebrities of the
day. The dreadful tragedy came later; at this time
he was one of the most brilliant figures in the literary
world.</p>

<p><br />"<i>March 24.</i> Longfellow died at about 3.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to-day.
He will be much and deservedly lamented. The
last of dear Chev's old set, the Five of Clubs, nicknamed
by Mary Dwight the 'Mutual Admiration
Society.' On hearing of this event, I put off my reception
for the Zuñi chiefs, which should have been on
Monday, when the funeral will probably take place."</p>

<p>"<i>March 26.</i> Dear Brother Sam came on very unexpectedly
to attend the funeral service held at the
Longfellow [house] for relatives and intimates. I also
was bidden to this, but thought it impossible for me
to go, lame as I am. Sent word out to Julia Anagnos,
who came in, and went in my place with Uncle Sam.
The dear old fellow dined with us. I got downstairs
with great difficulty and fatigue. We had a delightful
evening with him, but he would go back to New York
by the night train."</p>

<p>"<i>March 30.</i> To-day the Zuñi chiefs and Mr. Cushing,
their interpreter and adopted son, came to luncheon
at 1.45. There were twelve Indian chiefs in full
Indian dress. Reception afterwards."</p>


<p><br />The Zuñi Indians live in Arizona. Once in the year
they make a pilgrimage to the seashore, and wading
into the ocean at sunrise, offer prayer to the Great
Spirit, and fill their vessels of woven grass with water
to be used through the year in their religious exercises.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75b" id="Page_75b">[75]</a></span>
This pilgrimage had always been made to the Pacific;
but in the hearts of the tribe lingered a tradition that
once in a hundred years the "Water of Sunrise" should
be visited, and they dreamed of the Eastern ocean. The
tradition was now confirmed, the dream fulfilled,
through the friendly offices of Mr. Cushing.</p>

<p>The ceremony was one of touching interest; hundreds
of people gathered at City Point to watch it.
Most of the spectators felt the beauty and solemnity
of the service (for such it was), but a few were inclined
to jeer, till they were sternly rebuked by Phillips
Brooks.</p>

<p>As our mother could not go to see the Zuñis, they
must come to see her, and Mr. Cushing gladly brought
them. They were grave, stalwart men, with a beautiful
dignity of carriage and demeanor. A picture not to
be forgotten is that of her in her white dress, bending
eagerly forward to listen while the chiefs, sitting in a
circle on the floor, told stories, Mr. Cushing interpreting
for her benefit. At parting, each man took her
hand, and raised it to his forehead with a gesture of
perfect grace. The eldest chief, before this salute, held
her hand a moment, and blew across the palm, east
and west. "Daughter," he said, "our paths have
crossed here. May yours be bright hereafter!"</p>


<p><br />"<i>April 1.</i> To-day Edward [Everett] Hale brought
me a parting memento of the Zuñis&mdash;the basket with
which they had dipped up the water from the 'ocean
of sunrise.' Mr. Cushing sent this. E. E. H. also spoke
about five hymns which should be written corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76b" id="Page_76b">[76]</a></span>
to the five great hymns of the Catholic mass. He
asked me to write one of these and I promised to
try."</p>

<p>"<i>April 16.</i> Splint off to-day. Waited for Dr. Beach,
so could not go to church. Had an interesting talk with
the Doctor on the Immortality of the Soul, in which
he is a believer."</p>

<p>"<i>April 27.</i> Made to-day a good start in writing
about Margaret Fuller. This night at 8.50 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> died
Ralph Waldo Emerson, <i>i.e.</i>, all of him that could die.
I think of him as a father gone&mdash;father of so much
beauty, of so much modern thought."</p>

<p>"<i>May 7.</i> To church, going out for the first time
without a crutch, using only my cane.</p>

<p>"J. F. C.'s sermon was about Emerson, and was
very interesting and delicately appreciative. I think
that he exaggerated Emerson's solid and practical
effect in the promotion of modern liberalism. The
change was in the air and was to come. It was in many
minds quite independently of Mr. Emerson. He was
the foremost literary man of his day in America, philosopher,
poet, reformer, all in one. But he did not
make his age, which was an age of great men and of
great things."</p>

<p>"<i>May 14.</i> Had a sudden thought in church of a
minister preaching in a pulpit and a fiend waiting
to carry him off to hell. Made some verses out of
this.</p>

<p>"This is Whitsunday.... I do hope and pray for
a fresh outpouring this year. While I listened to Dr.
Furness, two points grew clear to me: one was, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77b" id="Page_77b">[77]</a></span>
would hold my Peace Meeting, if I should hold it alone,
as a priest sometimes serves his mass. The second was,
that I could preach from the text: 'As ye have borne
the image of the earthy, so shall ye bear the image of
the heavenly,' and this sermon I think I could preach
to the prisoners, as I once tried to do years ago when
dear Chev found the idea so intolerable that I had to
give it up. I am twenty years older now, and the
Woman Ministry is a recognized fact.</p>

<p>"Still Sunday afternoon. I am now full of courage
for this week's heavy work."</p>

<p>"<i>May 30.</i> Alas! alas! dear Professor Rogers dropped
dead to-day after some exercise at the Institute of
Technology. How he had helped me in the Town and
Country Club! Without his aid and that of his wife, I
doubt whether I could have started it at all: he was
always vice-president as I was president. I cannot
think how I can do without him."</p>

<p>"<i>July 22.</i> Commemoration of Mr. Emerson at Concord
Town Hall. Several portraits of him and very
effective floral decorations; no music. Prayer by Rev.
Dr. Holland; introductory remarks by F. B. Sanborn
in which he quoted a good part of a poem by W. E.
Channing, R. W. E. its theme. Then came an unmercifully
long paper by Dr. X., much of which was
interesting and some of which was irrelevant. He insisted
upon Mr. Emerson's having been an evolutionist,
and unfolded a good deal of his own tablecloth
along with the mortuary napkin."</p>

<p>"<i>July 29.</i> Had a studious and quiet day. Was in
good time for the performance [at the Casino]...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78b" id="Page_78b">[78]</a></span>In a letter to "Uncle Sam" she speaks of "the labor
and fatigue of preparing for the theatricals, which are

My part was a short one, but I took great pains to
make it as good as I could. Some points which I
thought of on the spur of the moment added greatly
to the fun of the impersonation. We had a fine
house, and an enthusiastic reception. I had a floral
tribute&mdash;only think of it!&mdash;a basket of beautiful
roses...."</p>

<p>"<i>September 18.</i> Left Newport to attend Saratoga

<p>"<i>November 8.</i> Cousin Nancy Greene, my father's
cousin, enters to-day upon her ninety-ninth year. I
called to see her, going first to town to buy her some
little gift.... Had a very interesting talk with her.
She was nicely dressed in black, with a fresh cap and
lilac ribbon, and a little silk handkerchief. For her
this was quite an unusual toilette. I wished her a good
year to come, but she said: 'Why should I want to live
another year? I can do nothing.' I suggested that
she should dictate her reminiscences to the girl who
waits upon her and who writes, she says, a good hand."</p>

<p><br />The winter of 1882-83 found her once more with a
family of some size, her son and his wife joining forces
with her at 241 Beacon Street. In Harry's college
days, mother and son had made much music together;
now the old music books were unearthed, and the
house resounded with the melodies of Rossini and
Handel. It was a gay household, with Crawford living
in the reception room on the ground floor; play
was the order of the evening, as work was of the day.</p>

<p>The new inmates brought new friends to the circle,
men of science, the colleagues of her beloved "Bunko,"
now Professor Howe of the Institute of Technology,
Italians, and other Europeans introduced by Crawford.
There was need of these new friends, for old
ones were growing fewer. Side by side in the Journal
with the mention of this one or that comes more and
more frequently the record of the passing of some dear
companion on life's journey. Those who were left of
the great band that made New England glorious in
the nineteenth century held closely to each other, and
the bond between them had a touching significance.
Across the street lived Oliver Wendell Holmes; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81b" id="Page_81b">[81]</a></span>

<p>In a letter to her brother she speaks of "the constant
'tear and trot' of my Boston life, in which I
try to make all ends meet, domestic, social, artistic,
and reformatory, and go about, I sometimes think,
like a poor spider who spins no web.... Marion
has been very industrious, and is full of good work and
of cheer. His book ["Mr. Isaacs"] has been such a
success as to give him at once a recognized position,
of which the best feature, economically, is that it
enables him to command adequate and congenial
employment at fairly remunerative prices...."</p>

<p>Your letter makes me say that I don't know anything,
whether I have written or not, or ought to
write, or not. Mammy's poor old head is very much
worse than ever, and I don't get time even to read
letters, some days. I can't tell why, except that there
are many points and people to be reached, in one way
and another, and I rush hither and thither, accomplishing,
I fear, very little, but stirring many stews
with my own spoon. It seems to me that I could not
bear another winter of this stress and strain, which is
difficult to analyze or account for, as "she needn't
have done it, you know." Why she must do it, notwithstanding,
is hard to tell, or what it is in doing it
which so exhausts all nervous energy and muscular
strength. Now, darling, after this prelude in a minor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82b" id="Page_82b">[82]</a></span>

<p>I owe you two good long letters, and am ashamed
to think how long it is since you have seen my crabbed
chirography. Of course, it is the old story. I have
been dreadfully busy with all sorts of work, in all of
which I take delight, while yet to quote St. Paul, "The
good that I would I do not." To give you a few items,
I have just finished a short memoir of Maria Mitchell,
Professor of Astronomy at Vassar College. This was
an interesting task, but had to be very carefully done.
At the same time, I had to correct Maud's memoir of
me, which is to be published in the same collection of
biographies of <i>eminent</i> women! I think I am eminent
for undertaking ten times more than I can do, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84b" id="Page_84b">[84]</a></span>
doing about one tenth of it. Well&mdash;I have given
three Sunday preachments at a sort of Woman's
church which they have here. My themes were: "The
Order of the Natural and the Spiritual," "Tares and
Wheat," and "The Power of Religion in the Life." I
was in New York last Wednesday, to preside over the
mid-year Conference of the Woman's Congress....
I had a visit from Salvini the other day. He was most
charming, and sent me a box for last evening's performance
of "The Outlaw," in Italian: "Morte Civile."
I went, with my Harry and Laura, I in my best attire.
I had received some very beautiful roses, which I threw
upon the stage, at the recall after the third Act. To-day
I met Wendell Phillips in the street, and made him
come in to see Marion, whose letter on English rule
in India, printed in the New York "Tribune," he had
liked very much. Phillips asked me how I came to
live in this part of the city, and I told him about your
gift of the house.... Marion is sitting by my fire,
with Browning's "Jocoseria" in his hands, from which
he has been reading passages. It sounds strange and

<p>I give you to-day my first hour, or half-hour, as the
case may be, feeling that my long silence has been
abominable, and must be broken, even if you should
feel it to be your duty to throw an inkstand at my
head, in return for my letter. It is partly Backbone's
fault. Backbone has been so scrouged and put upon
by the summer's work that he sometimes cuts up
amazing. Said work is pretty well out of hand at this
moment, the last chapters of "Margaret Fuller" being
ready for the press.... I have so much felt the
shocking uncharity of things in the way of diaries and
letters which have been published within the last few
years. Not the least bad exhibition in this kind has
been made by Carlyle and his wife. I have just finished
reading the three volumes of her letters and
memorials, which were indeed interesting to me by the
mention in them of persons whom I myself have
known. Still, the spirit of the book is painful. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86b" id="Page_86b">[86]</a></span>
sad to see how she adopted, at times, her husband's
harsh creed. I should think Froude, the editor, must
be wanting in common taste and decency, to have
allowed the letters to appear in all this crudeness. I
am so glad that I never went near them, after that one
tea-drink, a very bad one, forty years ago. Is this
enough about the Carlyles? And is it strictly charitable?
I dunno; I'm getting very old to know anything....</p></blockquote>


<p><br />The "Life of Margaret Fuller" (in Roberts Brothers'
series of "Famous Women") was a small book, yet
it stood for much careful work, and was so recognized
and received. The recognition sometimes took a singular
form, <i>e.g.</i>, a letter from a gentleman styling himself
"Prof. Nat. &amp; Geol.," who desires two copies of
the "Margaret Fuller," and asks her to "accept for
them a choice selection of '<i>Lithological</i>,' Cabinet of
Geological Mineral specimens, representing the Glacial,
and Emptus period, also the Crystalline formation
of the Earth's Strata, in Coolings, Rubbings, and
Scratchings of the Drift Age."</p>

has been here, and a very eminent Hindoo, named
Mozumdar. I have lost many of these doings by my
journeys, but heard Arnold's lecture on Emerson last
evening. I have also heard one of Cable's readings.
Arnold does not in the least understand Emerson, I
think. He has a positive, square-jawed English mind,
with no super-sensible <i>aperçûs</i>. His elocution is pitiable,

fatigue in the Merchants' and Mechanics' Fair, in
which she was president of the Woman's Department.

The exigencies of slavery quickened their individual
perceptions, and sharpened their wits, but left them
little opportunity for concerted action. Freedom allows
men to learn how to coöperate widely and strongly for
ends of mutual good. Despotism heightens personal

nothing so much as association among men, which it

when this later one arrived, giving me the full, desired
particulars of our dear one's last days on earth. You
and Annie both write as though the loss were heaviest
to me, and I only feel that I cannot feel it half
enough. The pathos of a life of such wonderful vicissitudes!
I cannot half take it in. What must he not
have suffered in those lonely days of wandering and
privation, while I was comfortable in my household!...
God knows, I had every reason to love him, for
he was heroically faithful to his affection for me.
Now, I feel how little I appreciated his devotion,
and how many chimeras, in my foolish wool-gathering
head, crowded upon this most precious affection, which
was worthy of a much larger place in my thoughts.
His death is a severe loss to Maud and me.... We
were always hoping to rejoin him, and to pass some
happy years with him. A great object is withdrawn
from our two lives. Nothing can take his place to
either of us.... As I write, the tears come. Like you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95b" id="Page_95b">[95]</a></span>
I long to sit and talk it all over with the two who are
all I have left of my own generation. To our children,
the event cannot be at all what it is to us. They are
made for the future, and our day is not theirs. I was
comforted, in your first letter, in reading of that
pleasant, quiet talk you had with him, when, among
other things, you read to him the lovely verses from
St. John's Gospel, which have become a classic of
consolation among Christian people. I believe that
he is in the heaven accorded to those who have loved
their fellow-men, for who ever coined pure kindness
into acts as he did? One of the lessons I learn from his
life is that it is very hard for us to judge rightly the
merits and demerits of others. Here was a man with
many faults on the surface, and a heart of pure gold
beneath.... The thought of his lonely funeral and
solitary grave has wrung my heart at times, but sometimes
I think of it as a place where one might be glad
to be at rest.... But now, dear, I have had all the
heart-break I can bear, writing this letter. Let me
now speak of the living and tell you where and how
we are.... I left very unwillingly to come down
here, and try to get my poor wrecked place in order.
You know, of course, that the dam which was built
to cut off my water, and against which I obtained an
injunction, burst this spring, and destroyed my two
ponds, my carriage, and a good part of my barn. I
have tried, in a lumbering way, to get justice, but have
not yet succeeded. I have had, too, a great deal of
trouble in my presidency of the Woman's Congress,
this year. Almost as soon as I open my eyes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96b" id="Page_96b">[96]</a></span>
morning, these black dogs of worry spring upon me.
I long to be free from them....</p></blockquote>

<p>Haven't I written to you? I have an idea of some
long letter of mine not answered by you. But this
may be one of those imaginary good actions which
help to puff me up. Life, you see, gallops on to such
a degree with me that I don't know much difference
between what I have intended to do and what I have
done....</p>

<p>I think novels is humbug. What you think? They
don't leave you anything but a sort of bad taste....</p></blockquote>


<p><br />"<i>August 27.</i> Simply good for nothing, but to amuse
the little Hall children. A strange dead level of indifference.
Do not see any difference between one
thing and another. This, I should think, must come
from a vagary of the liver. Worst sort of nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97b" id="Page_97b">[97]</a></span>
prostration&mdash;to prostrate one's self before one's nerves.
To town in the afternoon, when the dead indifference
and lassitude went off somewhat."</p>

<p>"<i>August 29.</i> We dined at the Booths' to-day, meeting
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Jefferson and William Warren.
A rare and delightful occasion. Jefferson talked
much about art. He, Booth, and Warren all told
little anecdotes of forgetfulness on the stage. Jefferson
had told a love-story twice, Booth had twice given
the advice to the players [in "Hamlet"], Warren, in
'Our American Cousin,' should have tried to light a
match which would not light. He inadvertently turned
the ignitable side, which took fire, and so disconcerted
him that he forgot where he was in the play and had to
ask some one what he had last said, which being told
him enabled him to go on."</p>

<p>"<i>September 25.</i> Finished to-day my Congress paper.
I have written this paper this week instead of going
to the Unitarian Convention, which I wished much
to attend.... I did not go because I thought I ought
neither to leave home unnecessarily, to spend so much
money, nor to put off the writing of the A.A.W.
paper.</p>

<p>"I shall look a little to see whether circumstances
hereafter will not show that it was best for me to follow
this course. My Dæmon did not say 'go,' but he
sometimes plays me false. I have certainly had the
most wonderful ease in writing this paper which, I
thought, would occupy a number of weary days, and
lo! it has all written itself, <i>currente calamo</i>."</p>

<p>My poor wits, in these days, are like bits of sewing
silk wound on a card. You unwind a little and straightway
come to an end. The wonder is, there are so
many ends. Here is a precise picture of our days as
passed at present. Morning, I wake early, lie and
think over my past life, with little satisfaction.
Bathe. Breakfast. Walk with Maud, Sonny<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> tugging
alongside. Maud goes much further than I do.
Sonny and I return, take a basket and gather dry
twigs to brighten the evening fire. I visit my mare in
her stable&mdash;a good custom, as my man is not over-careful
of her stall. Maud comes back, I <i>exercise</i> her
voice. I go to books, she to desk. Study Greek a good
deal, reading Thucydides and Aristophanes. Dinner,
coffee, more reading and writing, unless we go to
town. Evening, music, reading or cards, worrying
about &mdash;&mdash;, bed. I have not mentioned my own much
writing, because you will understand it. I am trying
to compass a story, but have my fears about it. My
paper for the Woman's Congress is entitled "How to
broaden the Views of Society Women." Darling dear,

<p><br />"<i>October 13.</i> To New Bedford, for the Suffrage
meeting; trains did not connect at Myricks, where,
after some delay and negotiation, I with difficulty persuaded
the conductor of a freight train to take me to
New Bedford in his caboose. This saved me time
enough to go to the Delano Mansion, restore my
strength with food, and put on my cap and ruche. The
Delanos were very kind. I read my Congress paper on
'Benefits of Suffrage to Women.'"</p>

<p>"<i>November 23.</i> To Louisburg Square to my old
friend's funeral [Hamilton Wilde].... Around and
before me were the friends and associates of the golden
time in which his delightful humor and <i>bonhomie</i> so
often helped me in charades and other high times. It
was ghostly&mdash;there were Lizzie Homans and Jerry
Abbott, who took part with him and William Hunt in
the wonderful charade in which the two artists rode a
tilt with theatre hobbies. The gray heads which I had
once seen black, brown, or blond, heightened the effect
of the picture. It was indeed a <i>sic transit</i>. I said to
Charles Perkins&mdash;'For some of us, it is the dressing
bell!' Oh! this mystery! So intense, so immense a
fact and force as human life, tapering to this little
point of a final leave-taking and brief remembrance!"</p>


<p><br />Now came the New Orleans Exposition, in which
she was to be chief of the Woman's Department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100b" id="Page_100b">[100]</a></span>It was already late when she received the appointment,
but she lost no time. Establishing her headquarters
at No. 5 Park Street (for many years the
home of the "Woman's Journal" and the New England
Woman's Club), she sent out circulars to every
State in the Union, asking for exhibits, and appealed
to the editors of newspapers all over the country to
send women correspondents for a month or more to
the Exposition. She called meetings in Boston, New
York, Providence, Philadelphia, and Hartford, at all
of which she spoke, imploring the women to bestir
themselves, and, late as it was, to make an effort to get
together a proper showing of women's work for the
great Fair.</p>

<p>Beside all this, she kept up through the autumn
an active correspondence with the Exposition authorities
at New Orleans.</p>

<p>The Exposition was scheduled to open on the 1st
of December: it did actually open on the 16th. She
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A steamer had been chartered to convey thither
the officers of the Exposition and their invited guests.
Seated on the deck, the chief of the Woman's Department
and her fellow-workers watched the arrival of
the high dignitaries of the State and city, escorted by
members of the military, and by two bands of music;
one, the famous Mexican Band. All the craft on the
river were adorned with flags and streamers. The
Crescent, which gives the city its familiar designation,
was pointed out, and the 'Father of Waters' was
looked upon with admiring eyes. The steamer brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101b" id="Page_101b">[101]</a></span>
us to the Exposition grounds, and here a procession
was formed in which the ladies of the Woman's Department
were assigned a place which they had some
difficulty in keeping. The march led to the Main Building.
The opening prayer was made by the Reverend
De Witt Talmage. At a given moment a telegram
was received from the President of the United States,
Chester A. Arthur, declaring the Exposition to be formally
open. Immediately after, the son of the Director-General,
a fine lad of twelve years, touched the electric
button by which the machinery of the Exposition
was set in motion.</p>

<p>"Returning by land, we found the streets gay with
decorations, in which the colors of the orthodox flag
were conspicuous."</p>

<p>Maud was with her, and shared her labors, as did
her devoted friend Isabel Greeley. At this time the
floor of the gallery destined for the women's exhibit
was not laid. By December 29 the officers of the department
were able to hold a meeting in "an enclosure
without doors or suitable furniture." When all was
supposed to be ready for the exhibits, it was found
that the roof leaked badly, the timber having so
shrunk under the action of the sun as to tear away the
waterproof felting. Moreover, there was not enough
money to carry on the business of the Department.
Funds had been promised by the Board of Management,
but these funds were not forthcoming, the Board
itself being in difficulties. Our mother had foreseen
this contingency.</p>

<p>"Ladies," she said, "we must remember that women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102b" id="Page_102b">[102]</a></span>
have sometimes built churches with no better instruments
than thimbles and a teapot! If the worst comes
to the worst, we must come before the public and
endeavor with its aid to earn the money necessary to
complete our enterprise."</p>

<p>This foreboding soon became a fact, and early in
January she found herself in rather a "tight corner."
She had sent out the call for exhibits to every State
in the Union; with great effort the women of the
country had responded most generously. She now felt
herself personally responsible for these exhibits, and
determined that, <i>coûte que coûte</i>, they should be well
displayed and the Woman's Department properly installed.</p>

<p>There was no money: very well! she would earn
some. She arranged a series of entertainments, beginning
with a lecture by herself. There followed a time of
great stress and anxiety, which taxed to the utmost
her mother-wit and power of invention. Faculties
hitherto dormant awoke to meet the task; she devised
practical, hard, common-sense methods, far removed
from her life habit of intellectual labor. She
had moved into a new apartment in the house of life,
one nearer the earth and not quite so near the stars.
She often quoted during these months Napoleon's saying,
on being told that something he wished to do was
impossible, "<i>Ne me dîtes pas ce bête de mot!</i>"</p>

<p>In spite of endless vexations, it was a time of tremendous
enjoyment; every nerve was strained, every
gift exercised; the cup of life was brimming over, even
if it was not all filled with honey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103b" id="Page_103b">[103]</a></span>"<i>January 13, 1885.</i> Preparing for my lecture this
evening. Subject, 'Is Polite Society Polite?' Place,
Werlein Hall. I was very anxious&mdash;the lecture appeared
to me very homely for a Southern audience
accustomed to rhetorical productions. My reception
was most gratifying. The house was packed and many
were sent away. Judge Gayarré introduced me. Joaquin
Miller came first, reciting his 'Fortunate Isles.'
I said in opening that even if my voice should not fill
the hall, my good-will embraced them all. Every point
in the lecture was perceived and applauded, and I felt
more than usually in sympathy with my audience."</p>

<p>"The second entertainment devised for the relief
of the Woman's Department was a '<i>Soirée Créole</i>,'
the third and last a 'grand musical <i>matinée</i>' at the
French Opera House, for which we were indebted to
the great kindness of Colonel Mapleson, who granted
us the use of the house, and by whose permission several
of his most distinguished artists gave their services.
Monsignor Gillow, Commissioner for Mexico,
also allowed his band to perform."</p>


<p><br />The difficulty of persuading the different artists to
sing, of pacifying their separate agents in the matter
of place on the programme and size of the letters in
which names were advertised, of bringing harmony
out of all the petty rivalries and cabals between the
different members of the troupe, required a patience
worthy of a better cause. Meanwhile there were other
troubles. Most of the women commissioners appointed
by the different States proved loyal comrades to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104b" id="Page_104b">[104]</a></span>
chief in her great and distressful labor; but there were
others who gave her endless trouble.</p>


<p><br />"<i>February 6.</i> Our concert. The weather was favorable.
Lieutenant Doyle came to escort me to the
theatre. My box was made quite gay by the uniforms
of several navy officers. The house was packed. We
took $1500 and hope to have more. I particularly enjoyed
the <i>Semiramide</i> overture, which the band gave
grandly. Rossini's soul seemed to me to blossom out
of it like an immortal flower."</p>


<p><br />These entertainments brought in over two thousand
dollars. This money enabled the women to install such
exhibits as were ready, to pay for a time the necessary
workmen, and to engage a special police force for the
protection of their goods. The United States ships in
the harbor also espoused the cause, Admiral Jouett,
of the flagship Tennessee, and Captain Kane, of the
Galena, sending experienced craftsmen whose ready
and skilful work soon changed the somewhat desolate
aspect of the gallery.</p>

<p>The arrangements were as simple as might be, the
greatest expense being the purchase of showcases. The
tables were of rough pine boards covered with cambrics
and flannels, the draperies of the simplest and
cheapest, the luxury of a carpet was enjoyed only here
and there; but the excellence of the exhibits, and the
taste with which they were displayed, made the department
a pleasant place. The winter was cold; the
wooden walls of the Government Building let in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105b" id="Page_105b">[105]</a></span>
a chilling blast; but there was a stove in the office of
the chief of installation, and with its help the daily cup
of tea was made which kept the workers alive.</p>

<p>Each State and Territory had a separate opening
day for its exhibit. These days were marked by public
meetings at which compliments were exchanged,
addresses made, and the exhibits turned over to the
management. It was considered obligatory for all
the commissioners to attend these meetings, and the
women spent many weary hours trying to hear the
addresses of distinguished individuals whose voices
contended in vain with the din of the machinery. The
Mexican Band played, and relieved the tedium of the
long sittings; but the women commissioners were upheld
chiefly by the feeling that they were drawn together
from all parts of the country, and were taking
an honored part in a great industrial and peaceful
pageant, whose results would be important to the
country and to mankind at large.</p>

<p>The Journal tells in February of the "opening of
the colored people's department; very interesting. A
numerous assemblage of them showed a wide range
of types. Music, military, drumming especially good.
Saw in their exhibit a portrait of John A. Andrew
which looked like a greeting from the old heroic
time."</p>

<p>The Woman's Department was formally opened on
March 3, though it had really been open to the public
since early January. The day was one of the gayest
in the history of the Exposition. The gallery of the
Government Building was bright with flowers and gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106b" id="Page_106b">[106]</a></span>
with flags. Admiral Jouett had sent the ship's band
as a special compliment; the music was delightful,
the speeches excellent. We quote from Mrs. Howe's
address:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish to speak of the importance, in an industrial
point of view, of a distinct showing of women's work
in the great industrial exhibits. There are few manufactures
in which the hand and brain of woman have
not their appointed part. So long, however, as this
work is shown merely in conjunction with that of men,
it is dimly recognized, and makes no distinct impression.
The world remains very imperfectly educated
concerning its women. They are liable to be regarded
as a non-producing class, supported by those to whom,
in the order of nature, their life is a necessary condition
of existence itself.... Exhibits like the present, then,
are useful in summing up much of this undervalued
work of women. A greater moral use they have in
raising the standard of usefulness and activity for
the sex in general. Good work, when recognized, acts
as a spur to human energy. Those who show how
women can excel are examples to shame those who
do not try. They lay upon their sex an obligation to
stronger endeavor and better action, and society gains
thereby.</p>

<p>"Still more have I at heart the association, in these
enterprises, of women who are not bound to each other
by alliance of blood, or affinity of neighborhood.
Greater and more important than the acquisition of
skill is the cultivation of public spirit. '<i>Pro bono publico</i>'
is a motto whose meaning men should learn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107b" id="Page_107b">[107]</a></span>
their infancy, and at their firesides. How shall they
learn it unless the women, the guardian spirits of the
household, shall hold and teach, beyond all other doctrines,
that of devotion and loyalty to the public good?</p>

<p>"I value, then, for the sake of both men and women,
the disinterested association of women for the promotion
of the great interests of society....</p>

<p>"You were stirred the other day by the bringing
back of a battle-flag whose rents had been carefully
mended. I tell you, sisters, we have all one flag now,
broad and bright enough to cover us all. Let us see
that no rent is made in it.</p>

<p>"All that the best and wisest men can imagine for
the good of the human race can be wrought if the best
women will only help the best men."</p>

<p><br />One of her most arduous tasks was the arranging
of a course of twenty-four "Twelve-o'Clock Talks,"
which were given every Saturday from the middle
of February till the close of the Exposition. How she
labored over them her companion daughter well remembers:
remembers too what success crowned the
effort. The subjects varied widely. Captain Bedford
Pym, R.N., discoursed on Arctic explorations; Charles
Dudley Warner told the story of the Elmira Reformatory;
the Japanese Commissioner spoke of woman's
work in Japanese literature. These talks were free to
the public, and proved so popular that eight years
later the same plan was carried out in the Woman's
Department of the Chicago World's Fair, and again
proved its excellence and value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108b" id="Page_108b">[108]</a></span>As if all this were not enough, she must found a
Literary Association among the young people of New
Orleans. She named them the Pans, and among their
number were several whose names have since become
well known in literature. Grace King, Elizabeth Bisland,
and others will remember those evenings, when
their bright youth flashed responsive to the call of
the elder woman of letters.</p>

<p>In all the stress and hurry, we find this entry:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear father's birthday. I left the Exposition
early and walked to visit dear Marion's grave in Girard
Street Cemetery. A lovely place it was. He is
buried above ground in a sort of edifice formed of brick,
the rows of coffins being laid on stone floors, each
single one divided from those on either side of it by
a stone partition. 'Francis Marion Ward, died September
3rd, 1847.' Erected by William Morse, dear
Marion's friend."</p>


<p><br />"<i>May 16.</i> Gave my talk to the colored people, soon
after two in the afternoon in their department. A
pretty hexagonal platform had been arranged. Behind
this was a fine portrait of Abraham Lincoln, with
a vase of beautiful flowers [gladiolus and white lilies]
at its base. I spoke of Dr. Channing, Garrison, Theodore
Parker, Charles Sumner, John A. Andrew, Lucretia
Mott, and Wendell Phillips, occupying about an
hour. They gave me a fine basket of flowers and sang
my 'Battle Hymn.' Afterwards the Alabama cadets
visited us. We gave them tea, cake and biscuits and
I made a little speech for them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109b" id="Page_109b">[109]</a></span>Winter and spring passed rapidly, each season
bringing fresh interest. The picturesqueness of New
Orleans, the many friends she made among its people,
the men and women gathered from every corner of
the world, well made up to her for the vexations which
inevitably attended her position. Looking back on
these days, she said of them: "It was like having a big,
big Nursery to administer, with children good, bad,
and middling. The good prevailed in the end, as it
usually or always does, and yet I used to say that
Satan had a fresh flower for me every morning, when
I came to my office, and took account of the state of
things."</p>

<p>The difficulties with which the unfortunate managers
were struggling made it impossible for them to
keep their promises of financial support to the Woman's
Department. Things went from bad to worse.
Finally she realized that she herself must find the
money to pay the debts of her department and to return
the exhibits to the various States. She wrote a
letter to John M. Forbes, of Boston, urging him to
help her and her assistants out of their alarming predicament.
Through Mr. Forbes, the Honorable George
F. Hoar, Senator from Massachusetts, learned the
state of the case. The sum of $15,000 had been named
as that necessary to pay all just claims and wind up
the affairs of the Department. At this time a bill was
before Congress for an appropriation to aid the Exposition.
Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Hoar, a sum of
$15,000 was added to this bill with the express clause,
"For the Relief of the Woman's Department." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110b" id="Page_110b">[110]</a></span>
bill was passed without discussion. The news was
received with great rejoicing in New Orleans, especially
in the Woman's Department, "where our need
was the sorest." The promise brought new life to the
weary workers; but they were to be far more weary
before the end. The Exposition closed on the last day
of May. Summer was upon them; the Northern women,
unused to the great heats of New Orleans,
longed to close up their business and depart, but the
money had not come from Congress, and they could
not leave their post. Days dragged on; days of torrid,
relentless heat. Our mother must borrow money for
the Department here and there to bridge over the gap
between promise and fulfilment. Worn out by fatigue,
anxiety, and the great heat, she fell seriously ill. Those
nearest her begged her to go home and leave to others
the final settlement of affairs, but she would not hear
of this. She would get well: she <i>must</i> get well! Rallying
her forces, mental and physical, she did get well,
though her illness for a time seemed desperate.</p>

<p>At long last, when June was nearly half over, the
money came, and with it the end of her long task.
Accounts were audited, checks drawn, exhibits despatched;
and with farewell greetings and congratulations,
"the whole weary matter ended." Her report as
President of the Woman's Department tells the story:</p>

<p>"The business of the Woman's Department having
thus been brought successfully to a close, it only remains
for its President to resign the office she has
filled, with some pain and much pleasure, for more
than six months,&mdash;to thank the officers of her staff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111b" id="Page_111b">[111]</a></span>
for their able and faithful services, the vice-presidents,
and the lady commissioners in general, for the
friendly support she has had from them almost without
exception....</p>

<p>"The classification by States she considers to have
justified itself, partly through the more distinct knowledge
thus gained of the work of women in localities
widely distant from each other, partly in the good acquaintance
and good-will developed by this method
of work. The friendly relations growing out of it still
bind together those who are now thousands of miles
apart, but who, we may hope, will ever remain united
in a common zeal for promoting the industrial interests
of women.</p>

<p>"Finally, she would say that she considers herself
happy in having taken part in an Exposition of so high
and useful a character as that which has latterly made
New Orleans a centre of interest in the civilized world.
She takes leave with regret of a city in which she has
enjoyed much friendly intercourse and hospitality; a
city in whose renewed prosperity she must henceforth
feel a deep and lasting interest."</p>

But the &mdash;&mdash;, and the &mdash;&mdash;, and the &mdash;&mdash;, taken
together, are enough to give one a turn at the worry-cat
system. Well 'm, I had also to see the distribution
of the whole edition of my New Orleans Report, and
I can only compare this to the process of taking down
a house, and of sending each individual brick somewhere,
labelled with your compliments; supposing
the bricks to be one thousand in number, it would
take some time to distribute them, Harry Richards
will be able to tell you how much time, and how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114b" id="Page_114b">[114]</a></span>
masculine oaths would go to each hundred of the articles.
Well, that's enough about that. You have had
one of my bricks sent you, and hang me if I believe
you have read it. Sweetison (a new little 'spression
which I have this minute invented), I stayed at Oak
Glen until Monday last, which was the 21st. Then I
came here by the way of Boston, and arrove on Tuesday
evening. Our quarters, or rather eighths, are
small, considering my papers and Maud's clothes. The
food is fine, the style first-rate, the rigs imposing to a
degree, but, ah! I kind of hate it all. New York is too
frightfully dirty! and then so stereotyped and commonplace.
Boston losing its prestige? Not as I am at
present advised....</p></blockquote>

<p>GIULIA ROMANA ANAGNOS</p>

<p>
Giulia Romana! how thy trembling beauty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That oft would shudder at one breath of praise,</span><br />
Comes back to me! before the trump of duty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had marshalled thee in life's laborious ways.</span><br />
<br />
We used to wonder at thy blush in hearing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy parents praised. We now know what it meant:</span><br />
A consciousness of their gifts reappearing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perchance in thine&mdash;to consummation blent.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, she was beautiful, beyond all magic<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of sculptor's hand, or pencil to portray!</span><br />
Something angelical, divinely tragic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tempered the smile that round her lips would play.</span><br />
<br />
Dear first-born daughter of a hero's heart!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pass to perfection, all but perfect here!</span><br />
We weep not much, remembering where thou art,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, child of Poesy! receive a tear.</span><br />


<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 10em;">T. W. Parsons</span>
</p>


<p><br />The years 1886 and 1887 were marked by two events
which changed materially the course of her private life:
the death of Julia, the beloved eldest daughter, and
the marriage of Maud, the house-mate and comrade.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1885-86 she made her headquarters
in New York. Lecture engagements, conferences,
and sermons took her hither and thither, and
much of the time that should have been "precious"
was passed in trains and boats.</p>

<p>In the last days of February, Julia was stricken with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116b" id="Page_116b">[116]</a></span>
rheumatic fever, which soon developed into typhoid.
The weather was "direful: bitter cold and furious
wind." Our mother went at once to South Boston,
where "arriving, found my dear child seriously but not
dangerously ill. Her joy at my coming was very
pathetic."</p>

<p>On the 28th she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot be sure whether it was on this day that
she said to me: 'Mamma, don't you remember the
dream you had when Flossy and I were little children,
and you were in Europe? You dreamed that you saw
us in a boat and that the tide was carrying us away
from you. Now the dream has come true, and the tide
is bearing me away from you.'</p>

<p>"This saying was very sad to me; but my mind was
possessed with the determination that death was not
to be thought of."</p>

<p>For a time conditions seemed to improve, and she
hastened to New York, where her presence was imperative;
but a telegram summoned her back: Julia was
not so well, and "a pain as of death" fell on the anxious
mother.</p>

<p>"Saw by Katie's face when she opened the door
that things were worse. I flew up the stairs and found
my darling little changed, except that her breathing
seemed rather worse. She was so glad to see me!...
About this time I noticed a change come over her
sweet face.... I felt, but would not believe, that it
was the beginning of the end. Julia was presently very
happy, with Michael on one side of her and myself on
the other. Each of us held a hand. She said: 'I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117b" id="Page_117b">[117]</a></span>
very happy now: if one has one's parents and one's
husband, what more can one want?' And presently,
'The angels have charge of me now, mamma and
Mimy.'<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> She said to me: 'What does the Lord want to
kill me for? I am dying.' I said, 'No, my darling, you
are going to get well.' She said: 'Remember, if anything
happens to me, you two must stay together.'...
A little later Michael and I were alone with her. She
began to wander, and talk as if with reference to her
club or some such thing. 'If this is not the right thing,'
she said, 'call another priestess'; then, very emphatically:
'Truth, truth.' These were her last words.</p>

<p>"My darling should have been forty-two years old
this day...."</p>

<p>A few days later she writes to Mary Graves:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not wild, nor melancholy, nor inconsolable,
but I feel as America might if some great, fair State
were blotted from its map, leaving only a void for the
salt and bitter sea to overwhelm. I cannot, so far, get
any comfort from other worldly imaginings. If God
says anything to me now, he says, 'Thou fool.' The
truth is that we have no notion of the value and beauty
of God's gifts until they are taken from us. Then He
may well say: 'Thou fool,' and we can only answer
to our name."</p>

<p>The Journal says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is the last day of this sorrowful March which
took my dear one from me. I seem to myself only dull,
hard, and confused under this affliction. I pray God
to give me comfort by raising me up that I may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118b" id="Page_118b">[118]</a></span>
nearer to the higher life into which she and her dear
father have passed. And thou? <i>eleison</i>...."</p>

<p>"Have had an uplifting of soul to-day. Have written
to Mary Graves: 'I am at last getting to stand
where I can have some spiritual outlook.' The confusion
of 'is not' is giving place to the steadfastness of
'is.' Have embodied my thoughts in a poem to my
dear Julia and in some pages which I may read at the
meeting intended to commemorate her by the New
England Woman's Club."</p>

<p>The Journal of this spring is full of tender allusions
to the beloved daughter. The dreams of night often
brought back the gracious figure; these visions are
accurately described, each detail dwelt on with loving
care.</p>

<p>In the "Reminiscences" she tells of Julia's consecrated
life, of her devotion to her father, and to the
blind pupils; describes, too, her pleasure in speaking
at the Concord School of Philosophy (where her "mind
seemed to have found its true level") and in a Metaphysical
Club of her own founding.</p>

<p>"It was beautiful to see her seated in the midst of
this thoughtful circle, which she seemed to rule with
a staff of lilies. The club was one in which diversity
of opinion sometimes brought individuals into sharp
contrast with each other; but her gentle government
was able to bring harmony out of discord, and to subdue
alike the crudeness of scepticism and the fierceness
of intolerance."</p>

<p>In the "Reminiscences" we find also the record of
Julia's parting injunction to her husband: "Be kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119b" id="Page_119b">[119]</a></span>
to the little blind children, for they are papa's children."</p>

<p>"These parting words," our mother adds, "are inscribed
on the wall of the Kindergarten for the Blind
at Jamaica Plain. Beautiful in life, and most beautiful
in death, her sainted memory has a glory beyond that
of worldly fame."</p>

<p>She considered Julia the most gifted of her children.
The "Reminiscences" speak of her at some length,
making mention of her beneficent life, and of her published
works, a volume of poems entitled "Stray
Chords," and "Philosophiæ Quæstor," a slender volume
in which she described the Concord School of
Philosophy and her pleasure therein.</p>

<p>In our mother's house of life, each child had its
special room, though no door was locked to any. In
all things pertaining to philosophy, Julia was her
special intimate. For help and sympathy in suffrage
and club doings, she turned naturally to Florence, an
ardent worker in these fields; with Harry she would
specially enjoy music; with Laura would talk of books;
while Maud was the "Prime Minister" in social and
household matters. So, till the very last, we gray-haired
children leaned on her, clung to her, as in the
days when we were children indeed.</p>

<p>A few years before Julia's death, our mother wrote
to Mrs. Cheney, who had lost her only daughter:
"This combat of the soul with deadly sorrow is a single-handed
one, so far as human help is concerned. I
do believe that God's sweet angels are with us when
we contend against the extreme of calamity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120b" id="Page_120b">[120]</a></span>Heavy as this affliction was, it brought none of the
paralysis of grief caused by Sammy's death: rather, as
after the passing of the Chevalier, she was urged by
the thought of her dead child to more and higher
efforts.</p>

<p>In the quiet of Oak Glen she wrote this summer a
careful study of Dante and Beatrice, for the Concord
School of Philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> July 20 found her at
Concord, where she and Julia had been wont to go
together. She says, "I cannot think of the sittings
of the School without a vision of the rapt expression
of her face as she sat and listened to the various
speakers."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Spite of her grief in missing this sweet companionship
she found the sessions of the School deeply interesting.
She was "much more nervous than usual"
about her lecture; which "really sounded a good deal
better than it had looked to me. It was wonderfully
well received."</p>

<p>We are told by the last living representative of the
School of Philosophy, Mr. F. B. Sanborn, that she
was the most attractive, and sometimes the most
profound, of its lecturers; "had the largest audiences,
and gave the most pleasure; especially when she
joined delicate personal criticism or epigrammatic wit
with high philosophy."</p>

<p>The meetings of the School were always a delight
to her; the papers written for it were among her most
valuable essays; indeed, we may look upon them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121b" id="Page_121b">[121]</a></span>
the flowering of all her deep and painful toil in the
field of philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>September finds her planning an "industrial circle"
in each State; a woman's industrial convention hereafter;
and attending a Suffrage Convention at Providence.</p>

<p>"Spoke of the divine right, not of kings or people,
but of righteousness. Spoke of Ouida's article in the
'North American Review.' It had been reported
that I declined to answer it. I said: 'You cannot
mend a stocking which is <i>all</i> holes. If you hold it up
it will fall to pieces of itself.'</p>

<p>"In the afternoon spoke about the Marthas, male
and female, who see only the trouble and inconvenience
of reform: of the Marys who rely upon principle."</p>

<p>After this we have "a day of dreadful hurry, preparing
to go West and also to shut up this house. Had
to work <i>tight</i> every minute...."</p>

<p>This Western lecture trip was like many others,
yet it had its own peculiar pleasures and mishaps.</p>

<p>"<i>October 12.</i> Dunkirk, lecture.... No one must
know that I got off at the wrong station&mdash;Perrysburg,
a forlorn hamlet. No train that would bring me
to Dunkirk before 6.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Ought to have arrived at
1.30. Went to the 'hotel,' persuaded the landlord to
lend his buggy and a kindly old fellow to harness his
horses to it, and drove twenty miles or more over the
mountains, reaching Dunkirk by 5.10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> When the
buggy was brought to the door of the hotel, I said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122b" id="Page_122b">[122]</a></span>
'How am I to get in?' 'Take it slow and learn to
pedal,' said my old driver. Presently he said, 'I guess
you ain't so old as I be.' I replied, 'I am pretty well
on toward seventy.' 'Well, I am five years beyond,'
said he. He drives an accommodation wagon between
Perrysburg and Versailles, a small town where a man
once wanted to set up a mill, and to buy land and
water power, and they wouldn't sell either. Whereupon
he went to Tonawanda and made the place.
'Guess they'd have done better to gin him the land
and water, and to set up his mill for him,' said my
man, Hinds."</p>

<p>On this trip she saw the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky,
taking the seven-mile walk; went as far as
Kansas City; was received everywhere with delightful
warmth.</p>

December 1, 1886.

<p>You see, I was waiting for the winter to begin, in
order to write you, and that you ought to have known.
But bless you, in Gardiner, Maine, you don't know
when real <i>Winter</i> begins, 'cause you have so much sham
winter. Well, better late than never. Here's thanking
you very much for the delightful [tea] cozy. Maud
said, "What are you going to do with it?" sarcastic-like.
I replied, "Put it on my head"; to which she
<i>inquit</i>, "Most natural thing for you to do." The sight
of the monogram gave me real satisfaction and a sense
of inborn dignity. You boil down to your monogram,
after all, and this one was beyond my highest expectations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123b" id="Page_123b">[123]</a></span>
I am only thinking, dear, whether you would
not have shown more respect by putting the crimson
satin bow on the monogram side, and thus, as it were,
calling attention to the distinguished initials.... I
am grinding now in all of my mills, of which one is a
paper for the "Woman Suffrage Bazaar," which paper
I am doing my best to edit. I cannot in conscience ask
you to send me anything for its columns, because,
poor dear, you have to do so much work on your own
account. At the same time, a trifling overflow into
the hat would be very welcome....</p></blockquote>


<p><br />Winter brought another grave anxiety. Florence
in her turn developed rheumatic fever and became
alarmingly ill. The mother-bird flew to her in terror.
On the way she met Henry Ward Beecher and told
him of her deep distress, made still more poignant by
the thought of the little children who might be left
motherless. She was scarcely comforted by his assurance
that he "had known stepmothers who were very
good to their stepchildren"!</p>

<p>It was Christmas time, and she divided her time
between the beloved patient and the children who
must not lack their holiday cheer.</p>

<p>"<i>December 27.</i> The day was a very distressing one
to me. I sat much of the time beside Flossy with a
strange feeling that I could keep her alive by some
effort of my will. I seemed to contend with God, saying,
'I gave up Julia, I can't give up Flossy&mdash;she has
children.'..."</p>

<p>"<i>December 28.</i> Most of the day with dear Flossy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124b" id="Page_124b">[124]</a></span>
who seems a little better. I sat up with her until 1.30
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and made a great effort of will to put her to
sleep. I succeeded&mdash;she slept well for more than an
hour and slept again for a good while without any
narcotic."</p>

<p>Throughout the illness she fought against the use
of narcotics.</p>

<p>The cloud of danger and anxiety passed, and the
year closed in happiness and deep thankfulness. The
last entry reads:&mdash;</p>

<p>"God bless all my dear people, sisters, children,
grandchildren, and cousins. God grant me also to serve
while I live, and not to fail of the high and holy life.
Amen!"</p>

<p>Maud was now engaged to John Elliott, a young
Scottish painter, whose acquaintance they had made
in Europe in 1878. The marriage took place on February
7, 1887. Though there were many periods of
separation, the Elliotts, when in this country, made
their home for the most part with our mother. The
affection between her and her son-in-law was deep;
his devotion to her constant. Through the years that
were to follow, the comradeship of the three was hardly
less intimate than that of the two had been.</p>

<p>The Journal carries us swiftly onward. In place of
the long meditations on philosophy and metaphysics,
we have brief notes of comings and goings, of speaking
and preaching, writing and reading. She works hard
to finish her paper on "Women in the Three Professions,
Law, Medicine, and Theology," for the "Chautauquan."
"Very tired afterwards."</p>

<p>She speaks at the Newport Opera House with Mrs.
Livermore (who said she did not know Mrs. Howe
could speak so well); she takes part in the Authors'
Reading for the Longfellow Memorial in the Boston
Museum, reciting "Our Orders" and the "Battle
Hymn," with her lines to Longfellow recently composed.</p>

<p>"I wore my velvet gown, my mother's lace, Uncle
Sam's <i>Saint Esprit</i>, and did my best, as did all the
others."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126b" id="Page_126b">[126]</a></span>The next day she speaks at a suffrage meeting in
Providence, and makes this comment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Woman suffrage represents individual right, integral
humanity, ideal justice. I spoke of the attitude
and action of Minerva in the 'Eumenides';<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> her resistance
to the Furies, who I said personified popular
passion fortified by ancient tradition; her firm stand
for a just trial, and her casting the decisive ballot. I
hoped that this would prefigure a great life-drama in
which this gracious prophecy would be realized."</p>

<p>In a "good talk with Miss Eddy,"<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> she devises a
correspondence and circular to obtain information
concerning art clubs throughout the country. "I am
to draft the circular."</p>

<p>She makes an address at the Unitarian Club in
Providence.</p>

<p>"The keynote to this was given me yesterday, by
the sight of the people who thronged the popular
churches, attracted, in a great measure no doubt, by
the Easter decoration and music. I thought: 'What a
pity that everybody cannot hear Phillips Brooks.' I
also thought: 'They can all hear the lesson of heavenly
truth in the great Church of All Souls and of All
Saints; <i>there</i> is room enough and to spare.'"</p>

<p>She writes a poem for the Blind Kindergarten at
Jamaica Plain.</p>

<p>"I worked at my poem until the last moment and
even changed it from the manuscript as I recited it.
The occasion was most interesting. Sam Eliot presided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127b" id="Page_127b">[127]</a></span>
and made a fine opening address, in which he
spoke beautifully of dear Julia and her service to the
blind; also of her father. I was joined by Drs. Peabody
and Bartol, Brooke Herford and Phillips Brooks.
They all spoke delightfully and were delightful to be
with. I recited my poem as well as I could. I think it
was well liked, and I was glad of the work I bestowed
on it."</p>

<p>She preaches at Parker Fraternity<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> on "The Ignorant
Classes."</p>

<p>Small wonder that at the Club Tea she finds herself
"not over-bright." Still, she had a "flash or two. The
state of Karma [calmer], orchestral conversation, and
solo speaking."</p>

<p>She hears the Reverend William Rounceville Alger's
paper on the "Blessed Life." "Very spiritual and in
a way edifying; but marred by what I should call
'mixed metaphysic.' One goes beyond his paper to feel
a deep sympathy with him, a man of intense intellectual
impulse, in following which he undergoes a sort
of martyrdom; while yet he does not seem to me to hit
the plain, practical truth so much as one might wish.
He is an estray between Western and Eastern thought,
inclining a good deal, though not exclusively, to the
latter."</p>

<p>She goes to conferences of women preachers, to
peace meetings; to jubilee meetings, in honor of Queen
Victoria; she conducts services at the Home for Intemperate
Women, and thinks it was a good time.</p>

<p>She "bites into" her paper on Aristophanes, "with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128b" id="Page_128b">[128]</a></span>
a very aching head"; finishes it, delivers it at Concord
before the School of Philosophy.</p>

<p>"Before I began, I sent this one word to Davidson,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
<i>eleison</i>. This because it seemed as if he might resent
my assuming to speak at all of the great comedian.
He seemed, however, to like what I said, and in the
discussion which followed, he took part with me,
against Sanborn, who accuses Aristophanes of having
always lent his wit to the service of the old aristocratic
party. Returned to Boston and took train for
Weirs, New Hampshire, where arrived more dead than
alive."</p>

<p>She is at Newport now, and there are tender notes
of pleasure with the Hall grandchildren, of "reading
and prayers" with them on Sunday, of picnics and
sailing parties.</p>

<p>Still, in dreams, she calls back the lost daughter;
still records with anxious care each visionary word and
gesture.</p>

<p>"Dreamed this morning of Charles Sumner and
dearest Julia. She was talking to me; part of the time
reclining on a sort of lounge. I said to some one, 'This
is our own dear Julia, feel how warm she is.'... I
think I said something about our wanting to see her
oftener. She said pathetically, 'Can't you talk of me?'
I said, 'We do, darling.' 'Not very often,' I think was
her reply. Then she seemed to come very near me, and
I said to her, 'Darling, do they let you come here as
often as you want to?' She said, 'Not quite.' I asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129b" id="Page_129b">[129]</a></span>
why, and she answered almost inaudibly, 'They are
afraid of my troubling people.' I stirred and woke;
but the dear vision remains with me, almost calling
me across the silent sea."</p>

<p>She writes innumerable letters; date and address of
each is carefully noted, and now and then an abstract
of her words.</p>

<p>"The bane of all representative action is that the
spur of personal ambition will carry people further
than larger and more generous considerations of good
are apt to do. So the mean-hearted and ambitious are
always forward in politics; while those who believe
in great principles are perhaps too much inclined to let
the principles do all the work...."</p>

<p>The following extracts hurry the year to its close:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>November 7.</i> Left for Boston by 10.20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> train,
to attend the celebration of Michael's [Anagnos] fiftieth
birthday at the Institution, and the opening
meeting of the N.E.W.C.... Arriving in Boston,
I ran about somewhat, fatiguing myself dreadfully.
Reached the Institution by 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, when, throwing
myself on the bed for necessary rest, the desired
rhymes for Anagnos's birthday flashed upon me, 'all
of a sudden,' and instead of napping, I called for pen
and ink and wrote them. The meeting was very good;
I presided. Dwight and Rodocanachi made speeches,
the latter presenting the beautiful chain given to
Michael by the teachers of the Institution. Michael
was much moved and could not but be much gratified.
I proposed three cheers at the end."</p>

<p>"I stole half an hour to attend a meeting in memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130b" id="Page_130b">[130]</a></span>
of Hannah Stephenson [the friend and house-mate of
Theodore Parker] of whom much good was said that
I did not know of. I reproached myself for having always
been repelled by her ugliness of countenance and
tart manner, and having thus failed to come within the
sphere of her really noble influence. The occasion recalled
a whole vision of the early and painful struggle
in Boston; of the martyrdom of feeling endured by
friends of the slave&mdash;of Parker's heroic house and pulpit.
It seemed, as it often does, great to have known
these things, little to have done so little in consequence."</p>

<p>"<i>November 27.</i> Finished my lecture on 'Woman in
the Greek Drama.' It was high time, as my head and
eyes are tired with the persistent strain.... All the
past week has been hard work. No pleasure reading
except a very little in the evening."</p>

<p>"<i>December 1....</i> Took 2.30 train for Melrose....
I read my new lecture&mdash;'Woman as shown by the
Greek Dramatists': of whom I quoted from Æschylus,
Sophocles, and Aristophanes. A Club Tea followed:
a pleasant one. I asked the mothers present whether
they educated their daughters in hygiene and housekeeping.
The response was not enthusiastic, and people
were more disposed to talk of the outer world,
careers of women, business or profession, than to
speak of the home business. One young girl, however,
told us that she was a housekeeping girl; a very
pleasant lady, Mrs. Burr, had been trained by her
mother, to her own great advantage."</p>

<p>"<i>December 18.</i> For the [Parker] Fraternity a text<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131b" id="Page_131b">[131]</a></span>
occurs to me, 'Upon this rock I will build my church.'
Will speak of the simple religious element in human
nature, the loss of which no critical skill or insight
could replace. Will quote some of the acts and expressions
of the true religious zeal of other days, and ask
why this means nothing for us of to-day."</p>

<p>Her first act of 1888 was to preach this sermon before
the Parker Fraternity. It was one of those best liked
by herself and others.</p>

<p>The great event of this year was her visit to California.
She had never seen the Pacific Coast; the Elliotts
were going to Chicago for an indefinite stay; her
sister Annie, whom she had not seen in many years,
begged earnestly for a visit from the "Old Bird."</p>

<p>She decided to make the journey, and arranged a
lecture tour to cover its expenses.</p>

<p>The expedition was throughout one of deepest interest.
It began with "a day of frightful hurry and
fatigue. I had been preparing for this departure for
some time past; yet when the time came, it seemed as
if I could hardly get off. Maud worked hard to help
me. She insisted upon arranging matters for me; went
to the bank; got my ticket. We parted cheerfully,
yet I felt the wrench. God knows whether she will
ever be in my house again, as my partner in care and
responsibility...."</p>

<p>After an "A.A.W." conference in Boston, and a
Woman's Council in Washington, she took the road.
Her first stop was at Chicago. Here she was "very
busy and not quite well. Divided the day between
Maud and some necessary business. At 3.15 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132b" id="Page_132b">[132]</a></span>
dreadful wrench took place. Maud was very brave,
but I know that she felt it as I did...."</p>


<p class="center"><i>To Maud</i></p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Merchants' Hotel</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">St. Paul, Minnesota</span>, April 10.
</div>

<p>So far, so good, my dear sweet child. I got me off
as well as possible, though we had many complications
and delays as to the ticket. My section was very
comfortable. I had supper in the dining-car, and slept
well, no theatre-troupe nor D. T. being aboard. I
have now got my ticket all straight to 'Frisco, and
won't I frisk oh! when I get there!</p></blockquote>


<p><br />The next stop was at Spokane Falls. Here she had
"a bronchial attack; very hoarse and sore in my throat
and chest. Went over my lecture carefully, leaving
out some pages. Felt absolute need of tea-stimulant,
and went downtown, finding some in a grocer's shop.
The good servant Dora made me a hot cup which
refreshed me greatly. Very hoarse at my lecture.
Opera House a good one enough; for a desk, a box
mounted on a barrel, all covered with a colored paper;
decent enough. Lecture: 'Polite Society'; well
received." The Spokane of to-day may smile at the
small things of yesterday; yet our mother always
spoke with pleasure of her cordial reception there.</p>

<p>Walla Walla, Walula, Paser. In the last-named
place she "found a tavern with many claimants for
beds. Mrs. Isaacs, who came with me from Walla
Walla for a little change of air, could not have a separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133b" id="Page_133b">[133]</a></span>
room, and we were glad to share not only a small
room but also a three-quarters bed. I was cramped
and slept miserably. She was very quiet and amiable."</p>

<p>At Tacoma again (on the way whither she felt as if
her life hung by a thread while crossing the Notch),
there was but one room for the two ladies, but they
occupied it "very peacefully."</p>

<p>After church at Tacoma "we heard singing in one of
the parlors, and went in quest of it. In the great parlor
of the hotel where hops take place, we found an
assemblage of men and women, mostly young, singing
Gospel hymns, with an accompaniment of grand
piano. The Bishop of New Zealand stood in the middle
of the apartment singing with gusto. Presently he
took his place at the instrument, his wife joining him as
if she thought his situation dangerous for a 'lone hand.'
A little later, some one, who appeared to act as master
of ceremonies, asked me to come over and be introduced
to the Bishop, to which I consented. His first
question was: 'Are you going to New Zealand immediately?'
He is a Londoner. 'Ah, come; with all
your States, you can show nothing like London.' Being
asked for a brief address, he spoke very readily, with
a frank, honest face, and in a genial, offhand manner.
A good specimen of his sort, not fine-brained, nor
over-brained, but believing in religion and glad to
devote his life to it. The Bishop has blue eyes and a
shaggy head of grizzled hair."</p>

<p>After Tacoma came "hospitable Seattle"; where she
lectured and attended a meeting of the Seattle Emerson
Club; then to Olympia, by a small Sound steamer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134b" id="Page_134b">[134]</a></span>"A queer old bachelor on board, hearing me say
that I should like to live in Washington Territory, said
he would give me a handsome house and lot if I would
live in Olympia, at which several Olympians present
laughed."</p>

<p>She left Olympia by train, <i>en route</i> for Portland.
The conductor, "Brown by name," saw the name on
her valise, and claimed acquaintance, remembering
her when she lived in Boylston Place. Soon after,
passing a lovely little mill-stream, with a few houses
near it, by name Tumwater, she consulted him as to
the value of land there, with the result that she bought
several acres of "good bottom land."</p>

<p>This was one of several small purchases of land made
during her various journeyings. She always hoped
that they would bring about large results: the Tumwater
property was specially valued by her, though
she never set foot in the place. The pioneer was strong
in her, as it was in the Doctor; the romance of travel
never failed to thrill her. Speeding hither and thither
by rail, her eye caught beauty and desirableness in a
flash; the settler stirred in her blood, and she longed to
possess and to develop. Tumwater she fondly hoped
was to bring wealth to the two eldest grandchildren,
to whom she bequeathed it.</p>

<p>In Portland she spent several days, lectured three
times, and was most hospitably entertained. On her
one disengaged evening she went down into the hotel
parlor, played for the guests to dance, played accompaniments
for them to sing. She spoke to the school
children; "she made slight acquaintance with various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135b" id="Page_135b">[135]</a></span>
people," most of whom told her the story of their
lives. Briefly, she touched life at every point.</p>

<p>Finally, on May 5, she reached San Francisco, and a
few hours later the ranch of San Geronimo, where the
Mailliards had been living for some years.</p>

<p>"Situation very beautiful," she says; "a cup in
the mountains." Here she found her beloved sister
Annie, the "little Hitter" of her early letters; here
she spent happy days, warm with outer and inner
sunshine.</p>

<p>California was a-tiptoe with eagerness to see and
hear the author of the "Battle Hymn"; many lectures
were planned, in San Francisco and elsewhere. The
Journal gives but brief glimpses of this California visit,
which she always recalled with delight as one of the
best of all her "great good times." In the newspaper
clippings, preserved in a scrapbook, we find the adjectives
piled mountain high in praise and appreciation.
Though not yet seventy, she was already, in the eye
of the youthful reporter, "aged"; her silver hair was
dwelt on lovingly; people were amazed at her activity.
One of the great occasions was the celebration
of Decoration Day by the Grand Army of the Republic
in the Grand Opera House, at which she was the
guest of honor. The house was packed; the stage
brilliant with flowers and emblems. Her name was
cheered to the echo. She spoke a few words of acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"I join in this celebration with thrilled and uplifted
heart. I remember those camp-fires, I remember those
dreadful battles. It was a question with us women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136b" id="Page_136b">[136]</a></span>
'Will our men prevail? Until they do they will not
come home.' How we blessed them when they did;
how we blessed them with our prayers when they were
in the battlefield. Those were times of sorrow; this
is one of joy. Let us thank God, who has given us
these victories."</p>

<p>The audience rose <i>en masse</i>, and stood while the
"Battle Hymn" was sung, author and audience joining
in the chorus.</p>

<p>After her second lecture in Santa Barbara, she
"sauntered a little, and spent a little money. Bought
some imperfect pearls which will look well when set.
Wanted a handsome brooch which I saw; thought I
had best conquer my desire, and did so."</p>

<p>At Ventura: "Got so tired that I could hardly dress
for lecture." The next day she proposed to Mrs. S.
at dinner (1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>) to invite some young people for the
evening, promising to play for them to dance. "She
[Mrs. S.] ordered a buggy and drove about the village.
Her son stretched a burlap on the straw matting and
waxed it. About thirty came. We had some sweet
music, singers with good voices, and among others a
pupil of Perabo, who was really interesting and remarkable."</p>

<p>At one of the hospitable cities, a gentleman asked
her to drive with him, drove her about for a couple
of hours, descanting upon the beauties of the place,
and afterwards proclaimed that Mrs. Howe was the
most agreeable woman he had ever met. "And I never
once opened my lips!" she said.</p>

<p>On June 10 she preached in Oakland: "the one sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137b" id="Page_137b">[137]</a></span>
which I have felt like preaching in these parts:
'Thou art Peter, and upon this rock.' The house was
well filled.... After service as I leaned over to speak
to those who stopped to greet me, I saw one of our
old church-members, who told me, with eyes full of
tears, that our dear James Freeman Clarke is no
more. This was like an ice-bolt; I could not realize it
at first.</p>

<p>
"'A very tender history<br />
Did in your passing fall.'<br />
</p>

<p>"Years of sweet converse, of following and dependence,
end with this event."</p>


<p><br />So we come to the last day at the ranch, the parting
with the dear sister; the departure for San Francisco,
laden with roses and good wishes.</p>

<p>On the way eastward she stopped at Salt Lake City,
and went to the Mormon Tabernacle; "an enormous
building with a roof like the back of a turtle; many
tourists present. The Mormons mostly an ill-looking
and ill-smelling crowd. Bishop Whitney, a young man,
preached a cosmopolite sermon, quoting Milton and
Emerson. He spoke of the Christian Church with patronizing
indulgence; insisted upon the doctrine of
immediate and personal revelation, and censured the
Mormons for sometimes considering their families before
their church. Communion, bread in silver baskets
and water in silver cups, handed to every one, children
partaking with the rest; no solemnity."</p>

<p>"<i>June 26.</i> To visit the penitentiary, where thirty
Mormon bishops are imprisoned for polygamy. Spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138b" id="Page_138b">[138]</a></span>
with one, Bishop of Provo, a rather canny-looking
man, whom we found in the prison library, reading.
The librarian (four years' term for forgery) told me it
was the result of liquor and bad company. I said a
few motherly words to him and presently proposed
to speak to the prisoners, to which the jailer gladly
assented. I began by saying, 'I feel to speak to you,
my brothers.' Said that all of us make mistakes and
many of us do wrong at times. Exhorted them to
give, in future, obedience to the laws upon which the
existence of society depends. The convict Montrose
sent to me a little chain and ornaments of his own
making. I promised to send one or two books for the
library...."</p>

<p>So, through "bowery and breezy Nebraska; such a
relief to eyes and nerves!" to Chicago, where Maud
kept and comforted her as long as might be, and sent
her refreshed on her way; finally to Boston, where she
arrived half-starved, and so to Newport.</p>

<p><br />The summer entries in the Journal are varied and
picturesque. "My cow, of which I was fond, was
found dead this morning.... My neighbor Almy was
very kind.... I feel this a good deal, but complaining
will not help matters."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bancroft [George], historian, brought Dr.
Hedge to call after dinner. Mr. B. kissed me on both
cheeks for the first time in his life. We had a very
pleasant and rather brilliant talk, as might have been
expected where such men meet."</p>

<p>She writes to Maud:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Alger seized upon my left ear metaphorically
and emptied into it all the five-syllable words that he
knew, and the result was a mingling of active and
passive lunacy, for I almost went mad and he had not
far to go in that direction."</p>

<p>And again; apropos of &mdash;&mdash;: "How the great
world does use up a man! It is not merely the growing
older, for that is a natural and simple process; but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140b" id="Page_140b">[140]</a></span>
the coating of worldliness which seems to varnish the
life out of a man; dead eyes, dead smile, and (worst
of all) dead breath."</p>

<p>"<i>September 23</i>. To church in Newport. A suggestive
sermon from Mr. Alger on 'Watching,' <i>i.e.</i>, upon
all the agencies that watch us, children, foes, friends,
critics, authorities, spirits, God himself.</p>

<p>"As we drove into town [Newport] I had one of
those momentary glimpses which in things spiritual
are so infinitely precious. The idea became clear and
present to my mind that God, an actual presence,
takes note of our actions and intentions. I thought
how helpful it would be to us to pass our lives in a
sense of this divine supervision. After this inward
experience I was almost startled by the theme of Alger's
sermon. I spoke to him of the coincidence, and
he said it must have been a thought wave. The thought
is one to which I have need to cling. I have at this
moment mental troubles, obsessions of imagination,
from which I pray to be delivered. While this idea
of the divine presence was clear to me, I felt myself
lifted above these things. May this lifting continue."</p>

<p>"<i>November 4.</i> In my prayer this morning I thanked
God that I have come to grieve more over my moral
disappointments than over my intellectual ones.
With my natural talents I had nothing to do: with
my use or abuse of them, everything.</p>

<p>"I have thought, too, lately, of a reason why we
should not neglect our duty to others for our real or
supposed duty to ourselves. It is this: ourselves we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141b" id="Page_141b">[141]</a></span>
have always with us; our fellows flit from our company,
or pass away and we must help them when and
while we can."</p>

<p>On December 5 she hears "the bitter news of Abby
May's death. Alas! and alas! for the community, for
her many friends, and for the Club and the Congress in
which she did such great silent service. God rest her
in His sweet peace!"</p>

<p>On Christmas Day she went to "Trinity Church,
where I enjoyed Phillips Brooks's sermon. Felt much
drawn to go to communion with the rest; but thought
it might occasion surprise and annoyance. Going into
a remote upper gallery I was present at the scene, and
felt that I had my communion without partaking of
the 'elements.' These lines also suggested themselves
as I walked home:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"The Universal bread,<br />
The sacrificial wine,<br />
The glory of the thorn-crowned head,<br />
Humanity divine."<br />
</p>

<p>"The last day of the year dawned upon me, bringing
solemn thoughts of the uncertainty of life, and sorrow
for such misuse of its great gifts and opportunities as
I am well conscious of. This has been a good year to
me. It carried me to the Pacific slope, and showed me
indeed a land of promise. It gave me an unexpected
joy in the harmonious feelings toward me and the
members of A.A.W. at the Detroit Congress. It
has, alas! taken from me my dear pastor, most precious
to me for help and instruction, and other dear and valued

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>SEVENTY YEARS YOUNG</h3>

<h4>1889-1890; <i>aet.</i> 70-71</h4>

<p>
The seven decades of my years<br />
I figure like those Pleiad spheres<br />
Which, thro' the heaven's soft impulse moved,<br />
Still seek a sister star beloved.<br />
<br />
Thro' many sorrows, more delight,<br />
Thro' miracles in sound and sight,<br />
Thro' battles lost and battles won,<br />
These star-spaced years have led me on.<br />
<br />
Though long behind me shows the path,<br />
The future still its promise hath,<br />
For tho' the past be fair and fond,<br />
The perfect number lies beyond.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 15em;">J. W. H.</span>
</p>

<p><br />She was dissatisfied with herself in these days.</p>

<p>"<i>January 1, 1889.</i> In my prayer this night I asked
for weight and earnestness of purpose. I am too frivolous
and frisky."</p>

<p>"On waking I said, 'If God does not help me this
day, I shall not be able to finish my address' [for a
Washington's Birthday celebration at Newport]."</p>

<p>She thinks He did help her, as she found the vein
of what she wished to say, and finished it to her
"tolerable satisfaction."</p>

<p>"As I entered the hall in the evening, the thought of
Cinderella struck me, and I used it by comparing the
fashion, of which we make so much account, to Cinderella
with her rat horses and pumpkin carriage, so
resplendent until her hour came; then the horses would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144b" id="Page_144b">[144]</a></span>
not carry her, the golden coach would not hold her,
her illusory grandeur was at an end. Our cause of truth
and justice I compared to the Princess in her enchanted
sleep, who lies spellbound until the true champion
comes to rescue her, and the two go forth together,
to return to sleep and diversion, oh, never more."</p>


<p><br />This is the note throughout the Journal; the record
of work, the prayer for strength. Yet the friskiness was
there; no one but herself would have had less of it.</p>

<p>She had already entered the happy estate of grandmotherhood,
and enjoyed it to the full. New songs
must be made for the little new people, new games invented.
We see her taking a grandchild's hands in
hers, and improvising thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"We have two hands,<br />
To buckle bands!<br />
We have ten fingers,<br />
To make clotheswringers!<br />
We have two thumbs,<br />
To pick up crumbs!<br />
We have two heels,<br />
To bob for eels!<br />
We have ten toes,<br />
To match our nose!"<br />
</p>

<p>If the child be tired or fretful, "Hush!" says the
grandmother. "Be good, and I will play you the 'Canarybird's
Funeral.'" Off they go to the piano, and the
"Canarybird's Funeral" is improvised, and must be
played over and over, for this and succeeding grandchildren.
For them, too, she composed the musical
drama of "Flibbertigibbet," which she was to play
and recite for so many happy children, and grown folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145b" id="Page_145b">[145]</a></span>
too. Flibbertigibbet was a black imp who appeared
one day in the market-place, and playing a jig on his
fiddle, set all the people dancing whether they would
or no. She played the jig, and one did not wonder
at the people. Next came Flibbertigibbet's march,
which he played on his way to prison; his melancholy,
as he sat in durance; the cats on the roof of his prison;
finally, entrance of the benevolent fairy, who whisks
him off in a balloon to fairyland. All these, voice
and piano gave together: nobody who heard "Flibbertigibbet"
ever forgot it. She set Mother Goose
to music for the grandchildren; singing of Little Boy
Blue, and the Man in the Moon. She thought these
nursery melodies among her best compositions; from
time to time, however, other and graver airs came to
her, dreamed over the piano on summer evenings, or in
twilight walks among the Newport meadows. Some of
these airs were gathered and published in later years.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>


<p><br />In May of this year she notes the closing of a life
long associated with hers.</p>

<p>"<i>May 24.</i> Laura Bridgman died to-day at about
12 <span class="smcap">M.</span> This event brings with it solemn suggestions,
which my overcrowded brain cannot adequately follow.
Her training was a beautiful out-blossoming from
the romance of my husband's philanthropy. She has
taught a great lesson in her time, and unfortunates of
her sort are now trained, without question of the result.
This was to S. G. H. an undiscovered country in the
first instance. I cannot help imagining him as standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146b" id="Page_146b">[146]</a></span>
before the face of the Highest and pointing to his
work: happy, thrice happy man, with all his sorrow!"</p>


<p><br />The close of her seventieth year was a notable milestone
on the long road. May found her still carrying
full sail; a little more tired after each exertion, a little
puzzled at the occasional rebellion of "Sister Body,"
her hard-worked "A.B.,"; but not yet dreaming of
taking in a reef.</p>

<p>The seventieth birthday was a great festival. Maud,
inviting Oliver Wendell Holmes to the party, had
written, "Mamma will be <i>seventy years young</i> on the
27th. Come and play with her!"</p>

<p>The Doctor in his reply said, "It is better to be
seventy years young than forty years old!"</p>

<p>Dr. Holmes himself was now eighty years old. It
was in these days that she went with Laura to call on
him, and found him in his library, a big, bright room,
looking out on the Charles River, books lining the
walls, a prevailing impression of atlases and dictionaries
open on stands. The greeting between the two
was pleasant to see, their talk something to remember.
"Ah, Mrs. Howe," said the Autocrat, "you at
seventy have much to learn about life. At eighty you
will find new vistas opening in every direction!"</p>

<p>Ten years later she was reminded of this. "It is
true!" she said.</p>

<p>At parting he kissed her, which touched her deeply.</p>

<p>He was in another mood when they met at a reception
shortly after this. "Ah! Mrs. Howe," he said,
"you see I still hang on as one of the old wrecks!"</p>

<p>"Then, Madam," he cried with a flash, "you are

<p>To return to the birthday! Here are a few of the
letters received:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><i>From George William Curtis</i></p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">West New Brighton, Staten Island, N.Y.</span>,

May 9, 1889.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Elliott</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>I shall still be too lame to venture so far away from
home as your kind invitation tempts me to stray, but
no words of my regard and admiration for Mrs. Howe
will ever limp and linger. I doubt if among the hosts
who will offer their homage upon her accession to the
years of a ripe youth there will be many earlier friends
than I, and certainly there will be none who have
watched her career with more sympathy in her varied
and humane activities. Poet, scholar, philanthropist,
and advocate of true Democracy, her crown is more
than triple, and it is her praise as it may well be
her pride to have added fresh lustre to the married
name she bears.</p>

<p>I am sincerely sorry that only in this inadequate
way can I join my voice to the chorus of friendly rejoicing
and congratulation on the happy day, which
reminds us only of the perpetual youth of the warm
heart and the sound mind.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Julia</span>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>(I suppose I may still call you so&mdash;we are both so
young and inexperienced) I cannot let this anniversary
of your birth go by, without stretching out my
hands to you across the ocean, and throwing to you all
they can hold of good wishes, and affectionate thought,
and delightful memories. Though years have gone
by since I have seen you, you are still fresh, joyous,
and amusing, and charming as ever. Of this I am fully
persuaded, and often I look into that anxious mirror
of my mind, and see you and wander with you, and
jest with you and sing with you, as I used in the olden
days; and never will I be so faithless as to believe
that you are any older than you were&mdash;and I hope
earnestly you are no wiser and that a great deal of
folly is still left in you&mdash;as it is, I am happy to say,
in me.</p>

<p>For, after all, what is life worth when its folly is all
departed? When we have grown wise and sad as
well as old&mdash;it is time to say Good-bye. But that
time has not come for us yet. So let us still shout
<i>Evviva</i>!</p>

<p>I do not mention the fact of your age,&mdash;I don't
know it,&mdash;but if I should guess, from what I know
I should say twenty-five. I was twenty-eight when
I left America&mdash;and that is such a few months ago&mdash;and
I know you were born somewhat about the
same time.</p>

<p>You will receive a great many congratulations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149b" id="Page_149b">[149]</a></span>
expressions of friendship, but none more sincere than
those of</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Howe,&mdash;
</p>

<p>I shouldn't have suspected it, but if you say so, I
am bound to believe this improbability, as absurd as
Leporello's Catalogue for its numerals. If it be so&mdash;I
beg pardon&mdash;since it is so, I am glad that you are
going to take it cheerfully as who should say to Time,
"Another turn of the glass, please, my young friend,
I'm writing." But alas, I can't be there to take a glass
with you. You say, "if there be no obstacle." No
less than a couple of thousand miles of water, harder
to get over than the years themselves, which indeed
get behind more swiftly than they ought. I can at
least wish you many happy returns of the day and will
drink to your health on the 27th. I sail on the 18th.</p>

<p>Pray accept my thanks and regrets and make them
acceptable to your children.</p>

<p><br />The Journal thus notes the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150b" id="Page_150b">[150]</a></span>"My seventieth birthday. A very busy day for all
of us.... My head was dressed at eleven. All my
children were here, with daughter- and sons-in-law.
I had many lovely gifts. The house was like a garden
of costly flowers. Breakfast was at 12.30; was in very
good style. Guests: General Walker, John S. Dwight,
E. E. Hale, Mrs. Jack Gardner, Mmes. Bell, Pratt,
and Agassiz. Walker made the first speech at the
table, H. M. H.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> being toastmaster. Walker seemed to
speak very feelingly, calling me the first citizeness of
the country; stood silent a little and sat down. Dwight
read a delightful poem; Hale left too soon to do anything.
H. introduced J. S. D. thus: 'Sweetness and
light, your name is Dwight.' While we sat at table,
baskets and bouquets of wonderful flowers kept constantly
arriving; the sweet granddaughters brought
them in, in a sort of procession lovely to see. It rained
in the afternoon, but the house was thronged with
visitors, all the same."</p>

<p>A sober entry, written the next day, when she was
"very tired, with a delightful fatigue": but on the
day itself she was gay, enjoying her "party" to the
full, treasuring every flower, wondering why people
were so good to her.</p>

<p>The festivities lasted several days, for every one
wanted to "play Birthday" with her. The New England
Woman's Club gave her a luncheon, which she
valued next to the home celebration; the blind children
of the Perkins Institution must hear her speak,
and in return sing some of her songs, and give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151b" id="Page_151b">[151]</a></span>
flowers, clustering round her with tender, groping fingers
that sought to clasp hers. Moreover, the last week
of May is Anniversary Week in Boston. Suffragists,
women ministers, Unitarians, "uplifters" of every
description, held their meetings (traditionally in a
pouring rain) and one and all wanted Mrs. Howe.</p>

<p>"I have said to God on every morning of these busy
days: 'Give me this day,' and He has given them all:
<i>i.e.</i>, He has given me power to fulfil the task appointed
for each."</p>

<p>When she finally got to Newport, she was "dazed
with the quiet after the strain of heart and fatigue."</p>

<p>The ministry was much in her mind this summer.</p>

<p>"I take for my guidance a new motto: 'I will ascend';
not in my ambition, but in my thoughts and
aims."</p>

<p>"A dry Sunday, <i>i.e.</i>, no church, it being the women's
turn to go. I shelled peas for dinner. Began Rambaud's
'History of Russia.'... I think of two sermons
to write, one, 'A spirit of Power'; one, 'Behold,
I show you a more excellent way.'"</p>

<p>Suffrage had its meed too in these summer days.</p>

<p>"Have copied my Call for the Congress. In my
coming suffrage talks will invite women to study the
history of their sex in the past, and its destiny in the
future; inertia and ignorance are the great dangers of
society. The old condition of women largely increased
instead of diminishing these sources of evil. The women
were purposely kept ignorant, in order that they
might be enslaved and degraded. Inertia is largely
fostered by the paralysis of independent action...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152b" id="Page_152b">[152]</a></span>"I feel just now that we ought to try hard to have
all the Far West represented at the Denver Congress."</p>

<p>"Thought a book or article about 'Fooleries' would
be entertaining and instructive. The need of this element
in human society is shown by the ancient jesters
and court fools.... In Bible times Samson made
sport for the Philistines. People now do their own
dancing and their own fooling: some of it very dull.
Query: What ancient jests have been preserved? 'The
Fools of old and of all time' would not be a bad title."</p>


<p><br />In October came the Woman's Congress in Denver;
she was there, "attending all meetings and sessions."</p>

<p>"Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s paper on 'The Redemptive Power
of Art' was very so-so, and did not touch my conception
of the theme, viz., art made valuable for the
reform of criminals. I spoke of this with warmth."</p>

<p>After the Congress "the visiting ladies enjoyed a
drive about the city of Denver. I went early to the
High School with A. A. B.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Found Mrs. Cheney
speaking to the pupils assembled. She did not notice
our entrance and spoke of me very warmly. Presently,
turning round, she saw us and we all laughed. I spoke
to them of my 'drink of youth'; compared the spirits
of youth to steam given to carry them on a celestial
railroad; compared youth to wine in a beautiful vase;
spoke of ancient libations to the gods; our libation to
be poured to the true Divine; urged them not to starve
their studies in order to feed their amusements. 'Two
ways of study, one mean, the other generous.' Told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153b" id="Page_153b">[153]</a></span>
them not to imitate savages, who will barter valuable
land for worthless baubles; not so to barter their opportunities
for barren pleasures."</p>

<p>She preached at Unity Church Sunday morning.</p>

<p>"At Grace Church [Methodist] in the afternoon.
Spoke to the text, 'God hath not left himself without
a witness.' This witness is in every human heart; which,
with all its intense desires, desires most of all, law,
order, religion.... I applied my text to the coming
out into the new territories; a rough Exodus stimulated
by the love of gold; but with the army of fortune-seekers
go faithful souls, and instead of passing
out of civilization, they extend its bounds. 'Praise
waiteth for thee in Zion'&mdash;yes, but the Prophet says:
'The solitary places shall be glad for them,' et cetera.
I set this down for future use."</p>


<p><br />The Denver people were most friendly, and she
enjoyed the visit greatly. Thence she stepped westward
once more, lecturing and preaching as she went,
everywhere welcomed with cordial warmth, everywhere
carrying her ministry with her.</p>

<p>"A sweet young mother was dreadfully plagued
with two babies; I helped her as much as I could."</p>

<p>"A delicate young woman was travelling with her
father, a boy of five years, and a semi-friend, semi-help,
not much of either. This party sat opposite me
in the Pullman, and soon made acquaintance. She is
going for her health from Tacoma to California. An
odd-looking genius, something like &mdash;&mdash; in his
youth, got in somewhere and attracted my attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154b" id="Page_154b">[154]</a></span>
by his restless manner. I took him for no good; a gambler,
perhaps. He seemed to notice me a good deal....</p>

<p>"Made acquaintance with the odd-looking young
man. He is a timber-land broker. He had noticed me
because I reminded him of his mother. We became
friends. He told me his story. He brought another
gentleman, a man more of society than himself, and
we and Mrs. Campbell played whist. We were quite
gay all day. In the evening a sad, elderly man whom
I had observed, came over and showed me his wife's
photograph as she had looked in health, and then a
photograph of her in her last illness; he holding her
up in his arms. He said he was travelling to help his
sorrow.</p>

<p>"At Reading my two whist gentlemen cried out,
'<i>Tamales!</i>' and rushed out. They presently returned,
bringing some curious Mexican eatables, corn meal
with chicken and red peppers rolled in corn leaves.
These folk all left at Sacramento at three in the morning."</p>


<p><br />California was once more her goal. This second visit
was brief and hurried.</p>

<p>"Hurry, scurry to dress for the Forefathers' Day
celebration. Oakley was my squire. I was taken down
to dinner by Professor Moore, President of the occasion....
I was suddenly and unexpectedly called
for, and all were requested to rise, which was a great
honor done me. I spoke of two Congregationalists
whom I had known, Antoinette Blackwell, of whose
ordination I told; then of Theodore Parker, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155b" id="Page_155b">[155]</a></span>
I said, 'Nothing that I have heard here is more Christian
than what I heard from him.' I told of his first
having brought into notice the hymn, 'Nearer, My
God, to Thee,' and said that I had sung it with him;
said that in advising with all women's clubs, I always
urged them to include in their programmes pressing
questions of the day. Was much applauded.... They
then sang the 'Battle Hymn' and we adjourned."</p>


<p><br />She spent Christmas with Sister Annie, in great
contentment; her last word before starting for home
is, "Thank God for much good!"</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Boston.</span>
</div>

<p>I reached Boston very comfortably on Monday
night about eleven o'clock. I was slower than usual
[on the journey] in making friends with those around
me, but finally thought I would speak to the pleasant-looking
woman on my left. She had made acquaintance
with the people who had the two sections behind
mine. I had observed a gaunt young man going back
and forth, with a look on his face which made me say
to my friend in Number Nine: "That man must have
committed a murder." Who do you think he turned
out to be? Lieutenant Ripley, of the Vandalia, U.S.N.,
the great ship which went to pieces on the Samoan
reef. I, of course, determined to hear about it from
his own lips, and we had a most interesting talk. He
is very slight, but must be all nerve and muscle. All
the sailors in the top in which he was clinging for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156b" id="Page_156b">[156]</a></span>
life fell off and were drowned. He held on till the Trenton
came down upon them, when, with the others who
were saved in other parts of the rigging, he crept along
a hawser and somehow reached the Trenton. Fearing
that she would go to pieces, he started with fifteen
sailors to swim ashore&mdash;he alone was saved&mdash;he says
he is much practised in swimming. I spoke of this all
as a dreadful experience. "Yes," said he, with a twinkle
in his eye, "but the storm cleared out the Germans for
us." He was thrown ashore insensible, but soon recovered
consciousness&mdash;had been naked and without
food for thirty-six hours. Took a cup of coffee in one
hand, and a cup of brandy in the other, and swallowed
a little from each alternately, his refection lasting
from nine in the evening till one o'clock at night....</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">
<i>To the same</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>We have not seen the sun in some days. I hope that
he has shined upon you. Item, I have almost finished
my anxious piece of work for the N.Y. "Evening
Post," after which I shall say, "Now, frolic, soul, with
thy coat off!"</p></blockquote>


<p><br />In January, 1890, she "heard young Cram<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> explain
Tristram and Iseult,' and young Prescott execute some
of the music. It seemed to me like <i>broken china</i>, no
complete chord; no perfect result; no architectonic."</p>

<p>She never learned to like what was in those days
"the new music." Wagner and Brahms were anathema
to her, as to many another music-lover of her time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157b" id="Page_157b">[157]</a></span>
notably John Sullivan Dwight, long-time Boston's
chief musical critic. Many a sympathetic talk they
had together; one can see him now, his eyes burning
gentle fire, head nodding, hands waving, as he denounced
what seemed to him wanton cacophony. She
avoided the Symphony Concerts at which "the new
music" was exploited; but it was positive pain to
her to miss a symphony of Beethoven or Schubert.</p>

<p>In March of this year the Saturday Morning Club
of Boston gave a performance of the "Antigone" of
Sophocles.</p>

<p>"In afternoon to the second representation of the
'Antigone.'... On the whole very pathetic and powerful.
Mrs. Tilden full of dramatic fire; Sally Fairchild
ideally beautiful in dress, attitude, and expression.
The whole a high feast of beauty and of poetry. The
male parts wonderfully illusive, especially that of
Tiresias, the seer...."</p>

<p>I'se very sorry for unhandsome neglect complained
of in your last. What are we going to do about it? I
have now and then made efforts to reclaim the old
Party, but have long considered her incorrigible.
What shall we say, then? "Where sin doth abound,
Grace shall much more abound," or words to that
effect, are recorded of one Paul, of whom I have no
mean opinion. So, there's Scripture for you, do you
see? As I wrote you yes'day or day before, things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158b" id="Page_158b">[158]</a></span>
have been <i>hoppy</i> here since my return. The elder
Agassiz used to mention in his lectures the <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
and I think that's the creature (insect, I b'lieve) which
infests Boston. What I have hopped for, and whither
to, I cannot in the least remember. Flossy was here,
as you know, and I hop't for her. I also 'tended two
of the festival Oratorios, which were fine, but to me
very fatiguing. I find that I must take public amusements,
when I do take them, in the afternoon, as in
the evening bodily fatigue overmasters even the æsthetic
sense, and it is not worth while to pay a large
price for the pleasure of wishing one's self at home....
The benefit at Boston Museum for the Vincent Hospital
netted over $1600. It was a brilliant success,
but I caught there the first cold I have had since my
return from the Far West. Maud is very busy with
the flower table, which she has undertaken, <i>having
nothing to do</i>. This is for the Vincent Fair, which
will take place on Tuesday, 29th.... Have got a few
lovely books from Libbie's sale of the Hart collection&mdash;among
other things, a fine French edition of "Les
Misérables," which I am at last glad never to have
read, as I shall enjoy it, <i>D.V.</i>, in some of the long
reading days of summer....</p>

<p><br />When she reached Oak Glen in mid-June, she felt a
"constant discouragement"; was lonely, and missed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159b" id="Page_159b">[159]</a></span>
the cheerful converse of her club and suffrage friends.
"My work seems to me to amount to nothing at all."
She soon revived, and "determined to fulfil in due
order all the tasks undertaken for this summer; so
attacked the Kappa poem and wrote at a stretch
twenty-two verses, of four lines each, which was
pretty much my day's work. Read in Martineau, in
J. F. C., a little Greek, and the miserable 'Les Misérables.'"</p>

<p>She decided to hold some conversations in the Unitarian
parsonage, and wrote out the following topics
for them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Useful undertakings in this city as existing and
needed."</p>

<p>"How to promote public spirit in American men and
women."</p>

<p>"How to attain a just average estimate of our own
people."</p>

<p>"How far is it wise to adopt the plan of universal
reading for ourselves and our young people?"</p>

<p>"In what respects do the foreign civilizations retard,
in what do they promote the progress of our own
civilization?"</p>

<p>In August she preached to the women in Sherborn
Prison, choosing a "text of cheer and uplifting: 'Thine
is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.' Read
part of Isaiah 40th. Said that I had wished to bring
them some word of comfort and exhilaration. Pointed
out how the Lord's Prayer begins with solemn worship
and ascription, aspiring to God's Kingdom, praying
for daily bread and for deliverance from temptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160b" id="Page_160b">[160]</a></span>
and all evil; at the close it rises into this joyous strain,
'Thine is the kingdom,' et cetera. Tried to show how
the kingdom is God, the great providential order, before
and beyond all earthly government; then the
power, that of perfect wisdom and goodness, the power
to know and rule all things, to be everywhere and ever
present, to regulate the mighty sweep of stars and
planets, and, at the same time, to take note of the
poorest and smallest of us; the glory first of the visible
universe, glory of the day and night, of the seasons,
glory of the redeeming power of truth, glory of the inexhaustible
patience, of boundless compassion and love."</p>

<p>She enjoyed the visit to the prison and was thankful
for it.</p>

<p>A few days later, at a meeting in Newport, she heard
a lady demand that the children of genius should be
set apart from others for special education and encouragement,
receiving a pension even in their early
years. She demanded colleges of genius, and a retreat
for people of genius. By thus fostering juvenile promise,
we should produce giants and demigods.</p>

<p>"I, being called upon, gave the card house a tolerable
shaking, and, I think, brought it down, for which
several people thanked me."</p>

<p>Vividly as she lived in the present, the past was
never far from her.</p>

<p>"Had in the morning at first waking a very vivid
mind-picture of my sweet young mother lying dead,
with two or three of us little ones standing about her.
My brother Henry, two years my senior, laid his little
hand upon her forehead and said: 'It is as cold as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161b" id="Page_161b">[161]</a></span>
stone,' or some such comparison. I felt strangely, this
morning, the very pain and agony of that moment,
preceding the tragical vision of a life in which that
central point of nurture, a mother's affection and wisdom,
has been wanting. The scene in my mind was
only a vivid reminiscence of what actually took place,
which I never forgot, but I had not felt it as I did
to-day in many years."</p>

<p>Perhaps at heart she was always the little child
who used to say to herself at night, "Now I will
stretch out and make myself as long as I can, so that
the robbers will think I am a grown-up person, and
perhaps then they will not touch me!" "Then," she
told us, "I would stretch myself out at full length,
and go to sleep."</p>

<p>She was reading Martineau's "Study of Religion"
this summer with close attention and deep interest.
His writings gave her unfailing delight. His portrait
hung in her room; on her desk lay always a slender
volume of his "Prayers," her favorite passages marked
in pencil. When Louise Chandler Moulton lay dying,
the best comfort she could devise for her was the loan
of this precious little volume.</p>

<p>The "Study of Religion" is not light reading. We
find now and then: "Head threatening. Will not
tackle Martineau to-day"; and again: "My head is
possessed with my study of Martineau. Had a moment's
realizing sense this morning of the universe as
created and constantly re-created by the thought of
the will of God. The phrase is common enough: the
thought, vast beyond human conception."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162b" id="Page_162b">[162]</a></span>When her head was clear, she studied the great
theologian eagerly, copying many passages for more
complete assimilation.</p>

<p>September brought "alarums and excursions."</p>

<p>"Awoke and sprang at once into the worry saddle."</p>

<p>Another Congress was coming, another "A.A.W."
paper to be written, beside an opening address for the
Mechanics' Fair, and "1500 words for Bok," on some
aspect of the American woman.</p>

<p>She went to Boston for the opening of the Mechanics'
Fair, and sat beside Phillips Brooks in the
great hall. "They will not hear us!" she said. "No,"
replied Brooks. "This is the place where little children
are <i>seen</i> and not <i>heard</i>."</p>

<p>"Mayor Hart backed up the Tariff while I praised
Free Trade. My text was two words of God: 'Use
and Beauty.' My brief address was written carefully
though hastily."</p>

<p>There was no neighborly electric road in Rhode
Island in those days, and the comings and goings were
fatiguing.</p>

<p>"A hard day.... The rain was pitiless, and I in
my best clothes, and without rubbers. Embraced a
chance of driving to the Perry House, where ... it
was cold and dark. I found a disconsolate couple from
Schenectady who had come to Newport for a day's
pleasuring. Did my best to entertain them, walking
about the while to keep warm."</p>

<p>She got home finally, and the day ends with her
ordering a warm mash for the horse.</p>

<p>This horse, Ha'pence, a good and faithful beast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163b" id="Page_163b">[163]</a></span>
ran a great danger this summer. The coachman,
leaving in dudgeon, poisoned the oats with Paris green,
a diabolical act which the Journal chronicles with
indignation. Fortunately the deed was discovered in
time.</p>

<p>She was always thoughtful of animals. During the
reign at 241 Beacon Street of the little fox-terrier
Patch, it often fell to her lot to take him out to walk,
and she felt this a grave responsibility.</p>

<p>One day Patch ran away on Beacon Street, and
would not come back when she called him. At this
instant Dr. Holmes, passing, paused for a friendly
greeting.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Howe," he said, "I trust this fine morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Catch the dog!</i>" cried Mrs. Howe. One author flew
one way, one the other; between the two Patch was
caught and brought in triumph home.</p>

<p>One dog story recalls another. She was in the North
Station one day, about to start for Gardiner, as was
also the setter Diana, crated and very unhappy.</p>

<p>"Here, Auntie!" said the baggage-master; "you
set here and be company for the dog, and I'll get your
check!"</p>

<p>She complied meekly, and was found somewhat
later by her escort, "being company" for a much-comforted
Diana.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>A SUMMER ABROAD</h3>

<h4>1892-1893; <i>aet.</i> 73-74</h4>

<p>
Methinks my friends grow beauteous in my sight,<br />
As the years make their havoc of sweet things;<br />
Like the intenser glory of the light<br />
When the sad bird of Autumn sits and sings.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah! woe is me! ah! Memory,</span><br />
Be cheerful, thanking God for things that be.<br />

</p>


<p><br />The longing to revisit England and enjoy another
"whiff" of a London season was gratified in the summer
of 1892. Accompanied by the Elliotts and a
granddaughter, she sailed for Liverpool on the 4th of
June; "a day of almost inconceivable pressure and
labor. I could not waste one minute, yet could not
do some of the simplest things which I intended to do.
Our departure was tolerably decorous and comfortable."</p>

<p>"<i>June 13.</i> <i>At sea.</i> Have enjoyed some good reading,
and have read one book, 'Bel Ami,' by Guy de
Maupassant, which I found so objectionable that I
had to skip whole passages of mere sensual description.
My loathing of the book and its personages will
keep me from encountering again the filth of this
author...."</p>

<p>"<i>June 16.</i> <i>Chester.</i> Attended service in the Cathedral.
I first came to Chester as a bride, forty-nine
years ago; then in 1867 with dear Chev, Julia, and
Laura; in 1877 with dear Maud; and now with Maud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165b" id="Page_165b">[165]</a></span>
and her husband and my dear grandchild, Alice Richards.
These three periods in my woman's life gave me
much to think of."</p>

<p><br />June 18 found the party established in pleasant
lodgings in Albion Street, Hyde Park, where they were
soon surrounded by friends old and new.</p>

<p>"<i>June 21</i>.... In the afternoon Lady Aberdeen,
Arthur Mills, and Henry Harland visited me. A. M.'s
hair is quite white. It was only iron grey when we last
met, thirteen years ago."</p>

<p>"<i>June 22.</i> Mrs. Brooke Herford wrote to ask me
to come out this afternoon to meet Mrs. Humphry
Ward. The Albert Hall performance very interesting.
Lord Aberdeen sent his carriage for us. My seat was
next to that of the Countess, who appeared in a very
fine dress of peach-blossom corded silk, with white
lace draperies&mdash;on my left was Lord Brooke. Lady
Aberdeen introduced me to Lord Kenmare and Dr.
Barnardo. The singing of the children, a band of
rescued waifs, moved me to tears. The military drill
of the boys and the Maypole dance of the girls were
very finely done. There are more than 4000 of these
children in Barnardo Homes."</p>

<p>"<i>June 23.</i> To the first view of the Society of English
Portrait Painters. Portraits on the whole well
worth seeing&mdash;Herkomers <i>very</i> good, also Mrs. Anna
Lea Merritt's and others. A superb portrait of Cardinal
Manning, in full red and ermine. In the evening
Lady Aberdeen sent her carriage for me and I went
with her to a meeting of the Liberal League, at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166b" id="Page_166b">[166]</a></span>
she spoke with a pleasant playfulness, dwelling somewhat
upon the position that Home Rule, if given to
Ireland, would do away with the ill-feeling of the Irish
in America towards England. To lunch with Lady
Aberdeen. Lief Jones came into the meeting while
Lady Aberdeen was speaking, and with him Lady
Carlisle. She shook hands with me very cordially.
Presently Lief Jones began his address, which was
quite lengthy, presenting the full platform of the Liberal
Party. He is a brisk, adroit speaker, and made
points in favor of Woman Suffrage, of Home Rule, of
the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales
and Scotland, of the eight-hour labor law, of the purchase
of the waterworks, now owned by eight companies
in the city."</p>

<p>"<i>June 24.</i> The lunch at Lady Aberdeen's was very
pleasant. Mrs. Eva McLaren<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> talked with me, as
did Miss Ferguson. The American Minister, Robert
Lincoln,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> was introduced to me and was very friendly."</p>

<p>"<i>June 25.</i> Went to Toynbee Hall by Whitechapel
'bus. Had received a note, which I supposed to be
from a lady, offering to show me over the institution.
We were shown into a large room, bare of carpet, but
with some pictures and bric-à-brac. After waiting
half an hour, a young gentleman made his appearance,
a Mr. Ames&mdash;the letter had been from him. He
showed me Mr. Charles [not General] Booth's map
of gradations of wealth and poverty in London. The
distinctions are marked by colors and shades of color&mdash;criminal
centres designated by black. In the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167b" id="Page_167b">[167]</a></span>
to Sarasate's concert, all violin and piano-forte,
but very fine."</p>

<p>"<i>June 26.</i> To hear Stopford Brooke in the morning,
an interesting sermon.... He called the Agnostics
and Nirvanists a type found in many classes, but
not a class...."</p>

<p>"<i>June 27.</i> To lunch with Mrs. Harland. <i>Very</i>
pleasant. Edmund Gosse was the guest invited to
meet me. He was vivacious, easy, and agreeable. Also
the composer Marzials...."</p>

<p>"<i>June 28.</i> To Westminster Abbey. To Alice, its interest
seemed inexhaustible. It is so, indeed, had one
time to be 'strewing violets all the time,' as E. B. B.
said. Longfellow's bust has been placed there since
my last visit; the likeness is good. I wandered about
as long as my feet would carry me, thinking sometimes
of Gray's question, 'Can storied urn,' etc. The
Harlands came later and brought the composer of
'Twickenham Ferry.' With Alice to dine at Toynbee
Hall. A pleasant dinner. A bright young man, Bruce
by name, related to Abyssinian Bruce, took Alice in
to dinner&mdash;sitting afterwards in Ames's room, where
we met an alderman, a bricklayer, a trades' unionist;
later, we heard a lecture from Commander Gladstone,
on the Norman-Breton churches, with fine stereoscopic
plates. A violent storm came on, but we managed
to ''bus it' home, taking a cab only at Marble
Arch."</p>

<p>"<i>June 29.</i> To dine with the Greek Minister at eight
o'clock, and to the <i>soirée</i> of the Academy.</p>

<p>"To Chelsea, to call upon Mrs. Oscar Wilde....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168b" id="Page_168b">[168]</a></span>
He showed me with pride a fine boy of five years. We
had some talk of old times, of his visit to America;
I reminded him of the vermilion balcony at which
he laughed." [Wilde had complained that the usual
pronunciation of these words was prosaic.]</p>

<p>"<i>June 30....</i> Mrs. Oscar Wilde asks us to take
tea on Thursday; she has invited Walter Pater....
Have writ to James Bryce."</p>

<p>"<i>July 2.</i> To see Oscar Wilde's play, 'Lady Windermere's
Fan,' at St. James's Theatre. We went by invitation
to his box, where were Lady Wilde and Mrs.
Oscar. The play was perfectly acted, and is excellent
of its kind, the <i>motif</i> not new, but the <i>dénouement</i>
original in treatment. After the play to call on Lady
Rothschild, then to Constance Flower,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> who showed
us her superb house full of treasures of art."</p>

<p>"<i>July 4.</i> Mrs. [Edmund] Gosse came and took us
to Alma-Tadema's beautiful house and garden. He
met us very cordially. Mrs. Smalley came. She was
Wendell Phillips's adopted daughter. I had a pleasant
talk with her and with Mr. and Mrs. Hughes,
whom I charged with a friendly message to Thomas
himself. After this to Minister Lincoln's Fourth of
July reception. Harry White, Daisy Rutherford's
husband, was introduced."</p>

<p>Elsewhere she says of this visit to Alma-Tadema:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His charming wife, once seen, explains some of the
features of his works. She has yellow hair of the richest
color; her eyes also have a primrose tint, while her
complexion has a pale bloom of its own, most resembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169b" id="Page_169b">[169]</a></span>
that of a white rose. She gave us tea from
lozenge-shaped cups, with saucers to match. In the
anteroom below we admired a painting by her own
hand, of yellow jonquils and a yellow fan, on a dark
background. Her husband seemed pleased when we
praised this picture. So these two artists occupy their
golden nest peaceably, and do not tear each other's
laurels.</p>

<p>"Let me say here that the passion for the golden
color still prevails. In dress, in furniture, in porcelain,
it is the prevailing favorite. Long banished from the
social rainbow, it now avenges itself for years of neglect,
and, as every dog must have his day, we will say
that the yellow dog is now to have his, and that the
dog-star of this coming August will certainly be of his
color."</p>

<p>"<i>July 6.</i> With Maud to Liberty's, where she beguiled
me, alas! into buying a fine black silk mantle
for six guineas. To Nutt's in the Strand for my Greek
books. He had only the 'Nicomathean Ethics,' a fine
edition which I bought for twelve shillings. Then to
Poole's in Hallowell Street, where bought two editions
of Aristotle's 'Government,' with English notes. At
Poole's found a copy of Schiller's 'Robbers,' which I
bought for threepence."</p>

<p>"<i>July 7.</i> Afternoon tea with Mrs. Oscar, meeting
an aunt of Mrs. Wilde's, and Mrs. Burne-Jones. The
aunt had been in Japan&mdash;she had known Fenollosa
and Professor Morse. Then to Mrs. Louise Chandler
Moulton, who introduced a number of people, among
them William Sharp, a poet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170b" id="Page_170b">[170]</a></span>"<i>July 8.</i> I had rashly promised to lunch with the
Brooke Herfords at Hampstead, and to take five-o'clock
tea with Mrs. Rebecca Moore at Bedford Place.
The Herfords were delightful, and Hampstead is a
charming suburb. We saw the outside of Mrs. Barbauld's
house. Herford said much good of Cookson, a
farmer's son whom he had known in England from
his beginnings, a dignified, able, excellent man in his esteem.
From this a long distance to Mrs. Moore. We
reached her in good time, however. Found her alone,
in a pleasant little dwelling. Three ladies came to tea,
which was served quite in state&mdash;Stepniak<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> came
also."</p>

<p>"<i>July 9.</i> To lunch with Lady Henry Somerset.
Some talk with Lady H. about Mrs. Fawcett, et al.:
also concerning Mrs. Martin's intended candidacy for
the presidency of the United States, which, however
futile in itself, we deplore as tending to throw ridicule
upon the Woman's Cause. She thought that the Conservatives
would give women the Parliamentary Suffrage
in England on account of the great number of
women who have joined the Primrose League."</p>

<p>"<i>July 10.</i> To the Temple Church. The organ voluntaries,
strangely, I thought, were first Chopin's
'Funeral March,' second the 'Dead March' in 'Saul.'
A notable sermon from Dr. Vaughan. The discourse
was really concerned with the political situation of the
moment: the strong division of feeling throughout the
country, and the fears of many lest the doctrine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171b" id="Page_171b">[171]</a></span>
which they believe should be overthrown. He said
that the real Ark of God was the Church Universal,
which has been defined as the whole company of believing
Christian people throughout the world. Many
changes would occur, but the vital principle of religion
would prove itself steadfast&mdash;a truly noble sermon,
worthy of Phillips Brooks."</p>

<p>"<i>July 12.</i> To the New Gallery in which were two
fine portraits by Herkomer, a superb one of Paderewski
by Tadema, and one of Walter Crane by Watts,
also of distinguished excellence. Later, called upon
the Duchess of Bedford, a handsome woman, sister
to Lady Henry Somerset. We talked of her sister's
visit to the United States. I was well able to praise her
eloquence and her general charm. She has known
Lowell well. We talked of the old London, the old
Boston, both past their palmiest literary days. She
had heard Phillips Brooks at Westminster Abbey;
admired him much, but thought him optimistic."</p>

<p>"<i>July 14.</i> Was engaged to spend the afternoon at
Mrs. Moulton's reception and to dine with Sebastian
Schlesinger.... Many people introduced to me&mdash;Jerome,
author of 'Three Men in a Boat'; Molloy, songwriter;
Theodore Watts, poetical critic of the Athenæum.'...
At the dinner I met Mrs. O'Connor, who
turned out to be a Texan, pretty and very pleasant,
an Abolitionist at the age of six...."</p>

<p>"<i>July 15.</i>... To the Harlands', where met Theodore
Watts again, and had some good talk with him
about Browning and other friends. Also Walter Besant,
whom I greeted very warmly as 'our best friend.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172b" id="Page_172b">[172]</a></span>"<i>July 17.</i> A sermon of surpassing beauty and
power from the dear Bishop of Massachusetts [Phillips
Brooks].... The power and spirit of the discourse
carried me quite away. We waited to speak with him.
I had a dear grasp of the hand from him. I shook my
finger at him and said, 'Is this resting?' He laughed
and said, 'This is the last time. I shall not speak again
until I reach Massachusetts.' I wrote some lines on
coming home, only half expressing my thought, which
was that the mother of so brave a son could not have
had one coward drop of blood in her veins&mdash;another
little scrap, too, about the seven devils that Christianity
can cast out. General Walker in the afternoon
and the Harlands to dinner."</p>


<p><br />They left London to join Mrs. Terry at Schwalbach,
lingering for a little on the way in Holland and
Belgium.</p>

<p>"<i>July 27.</i> <i>The Hague.</i> To see Mesdag and his pictures.
Found Mesdag a hale man of perhaps fifty
years&mdash;perhaps less; a fine house, and, besides his
own paintings of which we saw a number, a wonderful
collection of pictures, mostly modern French, Troyon,
Corot, Rousseau, Daubigny. Some good things by a
Roman artist, Mancini, whom Mesdag praised highly&mdash;he
is very poor, but has some excellent qualities.
A picture of a little girl reclining on a pillow with a
few flowers in her hand, pleased me very much&mdash;he
also praised it. Much fine tapestry, china, etc., etc.
He was gruffly pleasant and hospitable."</p>

<p>"<i>July 28.</i> <i>Antwerp.</i> Visited Cathedral and <i>Musée</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173b" id="Page_173b">[173]</a></span>
Saw my picture, Rubens's Elevation of the Cross,
but felt that my eyesight has dimmed since I last saw
it. Found Félu, the armless artist, in the <i>Musée</i> copying
a picture of Godiva. He was very glad to see us.
Much talk with him about Flemish art. A little ramble
after dinner and a nibble at a bric-à-brac shop, which,
however, did not become a bite."</p>

<p>"<i>July 31.</i> <i>Cologne.</i> A great concourse of people
awaited the arrival of a steamer with the Arion Musical
Society of New York. Köln choral societies were
represented by fine banners and by members in mediæval
costumes, very picturesque. The steamer came
alongside with many flags, foremost among them our
own dear 'Stars and Stripes.' We waved handkerchiefs
vigorously as these last passed by, and were
saluted by their bearers."</p>

<p>"<i>August 2.</i> Left Cologne by Rhine steamer. I remember
these boats as crowded, dirty, and very comfortless,
but I found this one as well appointed as need
be. Spent the day mostly on deck enjoying the great
beauty and romance of the trip.... I chilled myself
pretty badly on deck, but stayed up until perhaps
half-past seven. A very young Westphalian on board
astonished us all by his powers of drinking and of
smoking. He talked with me; said, '<i>Sie sind deutsch,</i>'
which I denied."</p>

<p>"<i>August 3.</i> Reached Schwalbach at three. My dear
sister [Mrs. Terry] came out to greet us. The meeting
was a little tearful, but also cheerful. Much has
passed and passed away in these eventful years....
Presently Louisa and I were as though we had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174b" id="Page_174b">[174]</a></span>
been parted at all. She is little changed, and retains
her old grace and charm of manner."</p>

<p>"<i>August 4.</i> Out early with my sister. We have a
regular and restful plan of living. Meet after dinner,
coffee with my sister at half-past four, supper at half-past
seven, in the evening reading aloud and conversation.
I am miserable with pain, probably rheumatic,
in my left hip. Think I must have got a chill on the
Rhine boat. I say nothing about this. Daisy and
Wintie [Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Chanler] came this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"<i>August 7.</i> To Anglican service with my dear sister.
A dull sermon. The service indifferently read&mdash;just
the stereotyped Church of England article. My dreadful
hip joint does not ache to-day, and I am ready to
skip about with joy at the relief even if it prove but
temporary. The pain has been pretty severe and I
have said nought about it, fearing treatment."</p>

<p>"<i>August 9.</i> Read Aristotle, as I have done all these
days. Took up St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans,
with a more distinct view than heretofore of his attitude
relative to them, and theirs to him. Walked out
with my sister, and saw at the bric-à-brac booth near
the Stahlbrunnen a ring composed of a fine garnet,
set with fine diamonds, wonderfully cheap, 136 marks&mdash;I
foolishly wanted it."</p>

<p>"<i>August 16.</i> <i>Heidelberg.</i> To the Castle&mdash;an endless
walk and climb. I was here in 1843, a bride, with
dear Chev, my dearest brother Marion, and my cousin,
Henry Hall Ward. We went to the Wolfbrunnen
to breakfast&mdash;went on ponies to the Castle, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175b" id="Page_175b">[175]</a></span>
we wandered at will, and saw the mighty tun. Some
French people were wandering there also, and one of
them, a lady with a sweet soprano voice, sang a song
of which the refrain was: '<i>Comme une étoile au firmament</i>.'
H. H. Ward long after found this song somewhere.
His voice has now been silent for twenty years,
dear Marion's for forty-six, and here I come to-day,
with my grown-up granddaughter, whom dear Chev
only knew as a baby. How long the time seems, and
yet how short! Two generations have grown up since
then in our family. My sister Louisa, then a young
beauty, is here with me, a grandmother with grandchildren
nearly grown. 'So teach us to number our
days.'"</p>


<p><br />It seemed to the second and third generations that
the two sisters could hardly have been lovelier in that
far-off springtime than now in the mellow beauty of
their autumn. It was a delight to see them together, a
high privilege to sit by and listen to the interchange
of precious memories:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And do you remember again&mdash;"</p>


<p><br />"<i>August 24.</i> <i>Sonnenberg.</i>... At breakfast an elderly
lady seemed to look at me and to smile. I supposed
her to be one of my Club ladies, or some one who had
entertained me, so presently I asked her if she were
'one of my acquaintances.' She replied that she was
not, but would be pleased to make my acquaintance.
We met soon after in one of the corridors; having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176b" id="Page_176b">[176]</a></span>
incautiously mentioned my name, I asked for hers,
she replied, 'Sforza&mdash;Duchess Sforza Cesarini.' She
had been attracted by my Breton caps, and especially
by Daisy's beautiful version of this simple adornment.
She is a reader of Rosmini."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>


<p><br />The Duchess confessed afterward that she had requested
her maid to observe and copy the cap, and
had been somewhat troubled in mind lest she had been
guilty of a constructive discourtesy.</p>


<p><br />"<i>September 3.</i> Received and answered a letter from
Jenkin Lloyd Jones, informing me of my election to
an Advisory Board to hold a World's Unitarian Congress
at Chicago in September, 1893. I have accepted
this."</p>

<p>"<i>September 4.</i> My last day at Sonnenberg.... Gave
my sister my little old Greek Lexicon, long a cherished
companion. I had thought of reading the family one
of my sermons, but my throat was troublesome and
no one asked me to do anything of the kind. They
wished to hear 'Pickwick,' and a long reading was held
in my room, the fire in the grate helping to cheer us."</p>

<p>"<i>September 15.</i> Left Montreux for Paris. Reed
brought me a beautiful yellow rose, half-blown, upon
which I needs must exercise my old trick of versification.
Paper I had none&mdash;the back of a pasteboard
box held one stanza, the cover of a Tauchnitz the
others."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177b" id="Page_177b">[177]</a></span>"<i>September 18.</i> Heard to-day of the noble poet,
Whittier's death. What a great heart is gone with
him!"</p>

<p>"<i>September 22.</i> <i>Liverpool.</i> Embarked at about ten
in the morning. Edward Atkinson, wife and daughter
on board, a valuable addition to our resources."</p>

<p>"<i>September 29.</i> <i>At sea.</i> I said in my mind: 'There is
nothing in me which can redeem me from despair over
my poor life and wasted opportunities. That redemption
which I seek must be in Thee. There is no progress
in the mere sense of ill-desert. I must pass on
from it to better effort beyond, self-reproach is negative:
woe is me that I was born! Amendment must
have positive ground.' I wrote some lines in which a
bit of sea-weed shining in the sun seemed as an illustration
of the light which I hope to gain."</p>

<p>"<i>September 30.</i> A performance of Jarley's Wax-works
in the evening was much enjoyed. Edward
Atkinson as Mrs. Partington in my witch hat recited
some merry nonsense of Hood's about European
travel."</p>

<p>"<i>October 2.</i> <i>Boston.</i> In the early morning John M.
Forbes's yacht, the Wild Duck, hovered around us,
hoping to take off his daughter, Mrs. Russell....
Quite a number of us embraced this opportunity with
gratitude...."</p>

<p>"<i>October 3.</i> All seems like a dream."</p>

<p>"<i>October 7.</i> <i>Newport.</i> I begin my life here with a
prayer that the prolongation of my days on earth may
be for good to myself and others, that I may not sink
into senile folly or grossness, nor yet wander into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178b" id="Page_178b">[178]</a></span>
æsthetic conceit, but carry the weight of my experience
in humility, in all charity, and in a loving and serviceable
spirit."</p>


<p><br />The last entry in the Journal for 1892 strikes the
keynote of what was to prove the most absorbing
interest of the coming year.</p>

<p>"<i>December 31.</i> Farewell, dear 1892. You were
the real <i>quattro</i> centenary of Columbus's discovery,
although we have been so behind time as not to be
ready to celebrate this before 1893. 1492 was indeed
a year momentous to humanity."</p>


<p><br />To her many cares was added now work for the
Columbian Exhibition at Chicago. The Woman's
Department of the World's Fair was ably administered
by Mrs. Potter Palmer, who consulted her frequently,
her experiences in the New Orleans Cotton Centennial
proving useful in the Columbian Exhibition. The
"Twelve-o'Clock Talks," so successful in the Crescent
City, were, at her suggestion, repeated at Chicago,
and proved most valuable. The Association for the
Advancement of Women and many other associations
were to meet in Chicago this year. She writes
to the Reverend Jenkin Lloyd Jones concerning the
Parliament of Religions and the Unitarian Congress;
to Aaron Powell touching the Congress on Social
Purity. There are letters, too, about the Alliance
of Unitarian Women, the Congress of Representative
Women, and the Association of Women Ministers
and Preachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179b" id="Page_179b">[179]</a></span>"<i>January 7.</i> [<i>Boston.</i>] To speak to the Daughters
of the American Revolution at the house of Miss Rebecca
W. Brown. I had dreaded the meeting, feeling
that I must speak of suffrage in connection with the
new womanhood, and anticipating a cold or angry reception.
What was my surprise at finding my words,
which were not many, warmly welcomed! Truly, the
hour is at hand!"</p>

<p>"<i>January 8.</i> To speak for Dr. Clisby at Women's
Educational and Industrial Union. I had dreaded this,
too, fearing not to interest my audience. The occasion
was very pleasant to me, and, I think, to them; Mrs.
Waters endorsed my estimate of Phillips Brooks as a
perfectly disinterested worker. Mrs. Catlin of New
York agreed in my praise of Bishop Henry C. Potter
on the same grounds; both also spoke well in relation
to my most prominent point&mdash;emancipation from the
slavery of self."</p>

<p>"<i>January 23.</i> Oh! and alas! dear Phillips Brooks
died suddenly this morning at half-past six. Alas! for
Christendom, which he did so much to unite by redeeming
his domain in it from superstition, formalism,
and uncharity. Oh! to have such a reputation, and
<i>deserve it</i>!"</p>

<p>"<i>March 4.</i> To-day have been allowed to visit the
study of the late dear Bishop of Massachusetts. I took
this pin from his pincushion, to keep for a souvenir.
Made Rosalind write down the names of a number of
the books. The library is a very generous one, comprising
a large sweep of study and opinion. A charming
frieze over the large window had been painted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180b" id="Page_180b">[180]</a></span>
Mrs. Whitman. We entered with a reverent feeling,
as if in a sacred place.... The dining-room, and his
seat thereat, with portraits of his parents and grandfather.
The mother was of his color, dark of eyes and
hair, strong temperament, otherwise no special resemblance.
His father looked substantial but not
remarkable."</p>


<p><br />In mid-May she went to Chicago, to take part in the
World's Congress of Representative Women, and in
many of the other congresses and conferences of that
notable year.</p>

<p>"<i>May 16.</i> <i>Chicago.</i> Was appointed to preside to-day
over a Report Convention [of the above Congress];
went to Room 6 of the Art Palace and found
no one. Mrs. Kennard came presently, and Mrs.
Clara B. Colby, who stood by me bravely&mdash;when
about a dozen had gathered I opened the meeting.
Mrs. Colby read reports for two associations, British,
I think. A German delegate had a long report written
in German, which it would have been useless for her
to read. She accordingly reported as she was able, in
very funny English, I helping her when she was at a
loss for a word. Her evident earnestness made a good
impression. I reported for A.A.W., partly in writing,
partly <i>extempore</i>. In the evening read my paper
on the Moral Initiative as regards Women. The hall
[of Washington] was frightfully cold."</p>

<p>"<i>May 17.</i> Going to the Art Palace this afternoon I
found an audience waiting in one of the small halls
with no speaker. Madame C. had engaged to speak on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181b" id="Page_181b">[181]</a></span>
musical education. I was requested to fill the breach,
which I did, telling of the Boston Conservatory of
Music, early music in Boston, and down to our time.
Had an ovation afterwards of friendly handshaking."</p>

<p>"<i>May 19.</i> Meeting of National Alliance of Unitarian
Women."</p>

<p>"<i>May 27.</i> My seventy-fourth birthday. Thank God
for my continued life, health, and bodily and mental
powers. My prayer to Him is that, whether I am to
have a year, a month, a week, or a day more, it may
be for good to myself and others.</p>

<p>"Went to the Columbian Exhibition. Thomas's
Orchestra playing for Mrs. Potter Palmer's reception
given to the women of the Press Association. Later I
went into the model kitchen where tea was served by
the Cingalese. Mrs. Palmer asked me to follow her
brief address with a few words. I did this and told of
its being my birthday, at which Mrs. Palmer gave me
her bouquet of carnations, and the ladies present rose
and waved handkerchiefs. Read my sermon for to-morrow
twice and feared it might not strike a keynote
here."</p>

<p>"<i>May 28.</i> Rather nervous about getting to town in
time for my service at the Unitarian Church,&mdash;we
were in good time. My mind was much exercised about
my prayer, I having decided to offer the longer one,
which I did, I hope, acceptably. I don't think that the
sermon <i>told</i> as it did in Boston. The church is not easy
to speak in. Mr. Fenn said a few words very tenderly
about his pleasure in receiving me into his pulpit. The
pulpit roses were given me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182b" id="Page_182b">[182]</a></span>"<i>May 29.</i> Went to the Exposition, where met Mrs.
Charlotte Emerson Brown. Went with her to her space
in the Organization Room. She will receive and care
for my exhibits. Saw the very fine collection of club
manuals, histories, etc."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>"<i>May 30.</i> Made a little spurt to begin my screed for
Aaron Powell's meeting on Sunday. Went with dear
Maud and Helen Gardner to the Fair. Side-shows as
follows: Cairo Street, Cairo Theatre, Soudanese dancers
(very black savages wearing top tufts of black hair
or wool, clothed in strips of dirty white cotton cloth),
old Vienna, dinner at Vienna restaurant....</p>

<p>"The Cairo dancing was simply horrid, no touch of
grace in it, only a most deforming movement of the
whole abdominal and lumbar region. We thought it
indecent. The savages were much better, though they
only stamp their bare feet and clap their hands in
rhythm without music. One had a curious smooth
lyre, which seemed to give no sound. Their teeth were
beautifully white and regular. One of them came up to
me and said, 'Mamma,' as if to indicate my age. Then
into a bark hut, to see the Soudanese baby dance&mdash;a
dear little child that danced very funnily to a tum-tum."</p>

<p>Early June found her back in Boston and hard at
work.</p>

<p>"<i>June 8.</i> Finished my screed for the July 'Forum.'
Subject, 'A Proper Observance of the Fourth of July.'
I have prayed over this piece of work as over all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183b" id="Page_183b">[183]</a></span>
others which have been strung, one after another, in
this busiest of years for me. I have also despaired of it,
and am not yet sure of its acceptance."</p>

<p>Next day she felt that she "must see the last of
dear Edwin Booth." The Journal describes his funeral
at length; "the sun perfectly golden behind the
trees." She brought away a bit of evergreen from
the grave, and at church, two days later, "had the
sexton slide it in among the pulpit flowers; afterward
brought it home. Perhaps a silly fancy, but an affectionate
one." She wrote a poem in memory of
Mr. Booth, "not altogether to my satisfaction."
She felt his death as a real loss; he remained always
to her a beautiful and heroic figure, connected with
a great time.</p>

<p>"<i>June 15.</i> 'Thus far the Lord has led me on.' I have
had many pieces of work to accomplish, and when
almost despairing, seemed to have been uplifted right
into my working seat, and so have fulfilled my tasks
as well as I was able. Have still my Fourth of July
poem to write, and wish to write a poem in memory
of Edwin Booth. I'm hungry, oh! how hungry, for
rest and reading. Must work very hard for A.A.W.
this season...."</p>

<p>She went to Harvard Class Day this summer, her
eldest grandson, Samuel Prescott Hall, being of the
graduating class; drove out to Cambridge in a pouring
rain, and enjoyed the occasion. "I saw my Boy
march with his fellows; when they cheered Weld, I
waved a napkin."</p>

<p>The summer sped by on wings of study and work;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184b" id="Page_184b">[184]</a></span>
she was lame, but that gave her the more time for
writing. The Journal records many letters; among
other things, "a short screed for the man who asks
to be convinced that there is such a thing as soul."
In September she spread other wings and flew back
to Chicago for the Parliament of Religions, and some
last Impressions of the Dream City of the World's
Fair.</p>

<p>"<i>September 23.</i> Went to the Parliament of Religions
where Jenkin Lloyd Jones put me on the platform.
Heard Dr. Momery, who gave a pleasant, liberal, and
spirited address, a little <i>elementary</i>, as he closed by
reciting 'Abou Ben Adhem,' which is as familiar to
Americans as A B C. In the evening went to meet, or
rather find, the women ministers. Miss Chapin excused
herself from attending and asked me to run the meeting....
I read my short screed, briefly narrating my
own efforts to found an association of women ministers.
Miss Putnam and Mary Graves were appointed as
a committee to consult with me as to a plan of organization."</p>

<p>"<i>September 26.</i> Up early.... Visited the German
village, castle and museum, the mining, agricultural,
shoe and leather buildings for a brief space. Made a
turn in the Ferris Wheel.... Mary Graves came for
me, and we started for the Parliament in good time.
The first speaker was intolerably narrow and out of
place, insisting upon the hostility of Christ to all ethnic
religions. I could not refrain from taking him up a
little, very mildly. I was received with applause and
the Chautauqua salute, and my brief speech (fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185b" id="Page_185b">[185]</a></span>
minutes without notes) was much applauded. I was
very thankful for this opportunity."</p>


<p><br />This impromptu speech made a deep impression.
In the newspaper reports great stress was laid on it,
with singular result. She was amazed next day to hear
her name roared out in the Midway Plaisance by a
touter who stood at the gateway of one of the sideshows
where some Orientals were at prayer.</p>

<p>"Come in, all ye Christian people," the man cried.
"Come in and see these devout Mohammedans at
their devotions. Julia Ward Howe has knocked the
orthodoxy into a cocked hat."</p>

<p>The quiet little figure, passing in the motley throng,
paused for a moment and looked with astonishment
into the touter's face, which gave no sign of recognition.</p>

<p>"This," said a friend, who happened to come up at
the moment,&mdash;"this is fame!"</p>

<p>A DREAM OF THE HEARTHSTONE</p>

<p>
A figure by my fireside stayed,<br />
Plain was her garb, and veiled her face;<br />
A presence mystical she made,<br />
Nor changed her attitude, nor place.<br />
<br />
Did I neglect my household ways<br />
For pleasure, wrought of pen or book?<br />
She sighed a murmur of dispraise,<br />
At which, methought, the rafters shook.<br />

"Now, who art thou that didst not smile<br />
When I my maddest jest devised?<br />
Who art thou, stark and grim the while<br />
That men my time and measure prized?"<br />
<br />
Without her pilgrim staff she rose,<br />
Her weeds of darkness cast aside;<br />
More dazzling than Olympian snows<br />
The beauty that those weeds did hide.<br />
<br />
Most like a solemn symphony<br />
That lifts the heart from lowly things,<br />
The voice with which she spake to me<br />
Did loose contrition at its springs.<br />
<br />
"Oh, Duty! Visitor Divine,<br />
Take all the wealth my house affords,<br />
But make thy holy methods mine;<br />
Speak to me thy surpassing words!<br />
<br />
"Neglected once and undiscerned,<br />
I pour my homage at thy feet.<br />
Till I thy sacred law have learned<br />
Nor joy, nor life can be complete."<br />

<p><br />In the closing decade of the nineteenth century a
new growth of "causes" claimed her time and sympathy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187b" id="Page_187b">[187]</a></span>
The year 1891 saw the birth of the Society
of American Friends of Russian Freedom; modelled
on a similar society which, with "Free Russia" as its
organ, was doing good work in England.</p>

<p>The object of the American society was "to aid by
all moral and legal means the Russian patriots in their
efforts to obtain for their country political freedom
and self-government." Its circular was signed by
Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Julia Ward Howe,
John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, George
Kennan, William Lloyd Garrison, Henry I. Bowditch,
F. W. Bird, Alice Freeman Palmer, Charles G. Ames,
Edward L. Pierce, Frank B. Sanborn, Annie Fields,
E. Benjamin Andrews, Lillie B. Chace Wyman, Samuel
L. Clemens, and Joseph H. Twitchell.</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell, writing to Francis J. Garrison
in 1891, says: "Between mote and beam, I think <i>this</i>
time Russia has the latter in her eye, though God
knows we have motes enough in ours. So you may take
my name even if it be in vain, as I think it will be."</p>

<p>It was through this society that she made the
acquaintance of Mme. Breschkovskaya,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> the Russian
patriot whose sufferings and sacrifices have endeared
her to all lovers of freedom. The two women felt
instant sympathy with each other. Mme. Breschkovskaya
came to 241 Beacon Street more than once,
and they had much talk together. On one of these
occasions our mother was asked to play some of her
own compositions. Her fingers strayed from one thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188b" id="Page_188b">[188]</a></span>
to another; finally, on a sudden impulse, she struck the
opening chords of the Russian National Hymn. Mme.
Breschkovskaya started forward. "Ah, madame!"
she cried, "do not play that! You cannot know what
that air means to us Russians!"</p>

<p>At a great meeting in Faneuil Hall the two spoke,
in English and Russian respectively, while other addresses
were in Yiddish and Polish. All were frantically
applauded by the polyglot audience which
filled the hall to overflowing. William Dudley Foulke
presided at this meeting. Speaking with our mother
several years later, he reminded her of the occasion,
which he thought might have been of a somewhat
anarchistic tendency. He was not sure, he said, that
they had not made fools of themselves. "One can
afford," she replied, "to make a very great fool of
one's self in such a cause as that of Russian liberty!"</p>


<p><br />The year 1891 saw the birth of another society in
which she was deeply interested, the Women's Rest
Tour Association, whose object was "simply to make
it easier for women who need a trip abroad to take
one."</p>

<p>It was proved "that the sum of $250 was sufficient
to enable a woman of simple tastes to enjoy a summer's
vacation in Europe"; a travelling fund was established
from which women could borrow, or&mdash;in certain cases&mdash;receive
gifts; a handbook was issued, etc., etc.</p>

<p>In an unobtrusive way, the Women's Rest Tour
Association did and continues to do much good. She
was its president to the close of her life, and in silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189b" id="Page_189b">[189]</a></span>
and lovely tribute to her memory the office has since
then remained vacant.</p>

<p>In the early nineties all Christendom was aroused
by the outrages committed by the Turks in Armenia.
From almost every Christian country rose a cry of
horror: indignation meetings were called; protest,
denunciation, and appeal were the order of the day.
In Boston a meeting was held at Faneuil Hall (November
26, 1894), called together by the Boston
Armenian Relief Committee. She was on the platform,
and spoke from her heart.</p>

<p>"I could not," she says, "stay away from this meeting.
My heart was here, and I came, not so much to
speak, as to hear what is to be done about this dreadful
trouble. For something must be done. I have to pray
God night and morning that He would find some way
to stay this terrible tide of slaughter....</p>

<p>"I recall the first action of Florence Nightingale
when she went to take care of the sick and wounded in
the Crimean War. She found many things wanting for
the comfort of the soldiers in the hospitals, but she
could not get at them. Some seal or mandate was
waited for. 'The men are suffering,' Florence Nightingale
said. 'Break in the doors&mdash;open the boxes&mdash;give
me the blankets and medicines. I must have them!'&mdash;and
so she did. Now, the fleets of the Western nations
are waiting for some diplomatic development which
shall open the way for action. I think that we, the
United States of America, are now called upon to play
the part of Florence Nightingale; to take our stand
and insist upon it that the slaughter shall cease. Oh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190b" id="Page_190b">[190]</a></span>
let us give money, let us give life, but let us stand by
our principles of civil and religious liberty. I am sure
that if we do so, we shall have behind us, and with us,
that great spirit which has been in the world for nineteen
centuries past, with ever-increasing power. Let
us set up in these distant lands the shelter of the
blessed Cross, and of all that it stands for, and let us
make it availing once and forever."</p>

<p>Soon after this the Friends of Armenia organized as
a society, she being its president. Among its members
were William Lloyd Garrison, Henry Blackwell and
his devoted daughter Alice, and M. H. Gulesian.
Singly or in company they went about, through Massachusetts,
holding meetings, rousing the people to aid
in the protest of Christendom against heathendom, of
mercy against cruelty. "Spoke for Armenia," is a
frequent entry in the Journal of these days.</p>

<p>In one of these addresses she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It may be asked, where is the good of our assembling
here? what can a handful of us effect against this
wicked and remorseless power, so far beyond our reach,
so entrenched in the selfishness of European nations
who are the creditors of the bankrupt state, and who
keep her alive in the hope of recovering the debt which
she owes them? The walls of this old hall should answer
this question. They saw the dawn of our own
larger liberties. They heard the first indignant plea of
Wendell Phillips when, in the splendor of his youth,
he took the field for the emancipation of a despised
race which had no friends. So, on this sacred arena, I
throw down the glove which challenges the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191b" id="Page_191b">[191]</a></span>
Government to its dread account. What have we for
us in this contest? The spirit of civilization, the sense
of Christendom, the heart of humanity. All of these
plead for justice, all cry out against barbarous warfare
of which the victims are helpless men, tender
women and children. We invoke here the higher powers
of humanity against the rude instincts in which the
brute element survives and rules.</p>

<p>
"Aid us, paper, aid us, pen,<br />
Aid us, hearts of noble men!<br />
</p>

<p>"Aid us, shades of champions who have led the world's
progress! Aid us, thou who hast made royal the
scourge and crown of thorns!"</p>

<p>After hearing these words, Frederick Greenhalge,
then Governor of Massachusetts, said to her, "Ah,
Mrs. Howe, you have given us a prose Battle Hymn!"</p>

<p>The Friends of Armenia did active and zealous service
through a number of years, laboring not only for
the saving of life, but for the support and education
of the thousands of women and orphans left desolate.
Schools and hospitals were established in Armenia,
and many children were placed in American homes,
where they grew up happily, to citizenship.</p>

<p>Nearly ten years later, a new outbreak of Turkish
ferocity roused the "Friends" to new fervor, and once
again her voice was lifted up in protest and appeal.
She wrote to President Roosevelt, imploring him to
send some one from some neighboring American consulate
to investigate conditions. He did so, and his
action prevented an impending massacre.</p>

<p>In 1909, fresh persecutions brought the organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192b" id="Page_192b">[192]</a></span>
once more together. The Armenians of Boston reminded
her of the help she had given before, and asked
her to write to President Taft. This she promptly did.
Briefly, this cause with so many others was to be
relinquished only with life itself.</p>

<p>On the fly-leaf of the Journal for 1894 is written:
"I take possession of the New Year in the name of
Faith, Hope, and Charity. J. W. Howe."</p>

<p>"Head bewildered with correspondence, bills, etc.
Must get out of this or die."</p>

<p>"A threatening head, and a week before me full of
functions. I feel weak in mind and dazed with confusions,
but will trust in God and keep my powder dry."</p>

<p>"Hearing on Suffrage, Green Room, 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> My
mind was unusually clear for this speaking. I determined
to speak of the two sorts of people, those
who naturally wish to keep the best things for themselves,
and those whose appreciation of these things
is such that they cannot refrain from spreading them
abroad, giving freely as they have received. I was able
to follow and apply this tolerably in my ten-minute
speech...."</p>

<p>"Annual meeting of Rest Tour Association; a delightful
meeting, full of good suggestions. I made
one concerning pilgrimages in groups.... I had a
sudden glimpse to-day of the unfailing goodness of
God. This and not our merits brings the pardon of
our sins."</p>

<p>"To hear Irving in 'Louis XI'; a strong play and a
good part for him. Left after Act Fourth to attend
Mrs. Gardner's musicale, at which Busoni pounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193b" id="Page_193b">[193]</a></span>
fearfully. I said, 'He ought to play with his boots
on his hands.' He played two curious compositions of
Liszt's: St. Francis's Sermon to the Birds and to the
Fishes&mdash;much roaring as of old ocean in the second."</p>

<p>"<i>Boston.</i> Attended Mrs. Mary Hemenway's funeral
in the morning.... A great loss she is, but her life has
been a great gain. Would that more rich men had
such daughters! That more rich women had such a
heart!..."</p>

<p>"C. G. A. preached a funeral sermon on Mrs.
Hemenway. As he opened his lips, I said to myself,
'What can he teach us that her life has not taught us?'
The sermon, however, was most instructive. Such a
life makes an epoch, and should establish a precedent.
If one woman can be so disinterested and so wise,
others can emulate her example. I, for one, feel that I
shall not forget this forcible presentation of the aspect
of such a character, of such a history. God send that
her mantle may fall upon this whole community, stimulating
each to do what he or she can for humanity."</p>

</p>

<p>... Let me tell you of the abolition of the old Fast
Day and of the new holiday, April 19, ordained in its
stead. This, you may remember, is the anniversary of
the Battle of Lexington. The celebration here was
quite on a grand scale. The bells of the old North
Church were rung and the lanterns hung out. A horseman,
personating Paul Revere, rode out to rouse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194b" id="Page_194b">[194]</a></span>
farmers of Concord and Lexington, and a sham fight,
imitating the real one, actually came off with an immense
concourse of spectators. The Daughters of the
American Revolution had made me promise to go to
their celebration at the Old South, where I sat upon
the platform with Mrs. Sam Eliot, Regent, and with
the two orators of the day, Professor Channing and
Edward Hale. I wore the changeable silk that Jenny
Nelson made, the Gardner cashmere, and the <i>bonnet</i>
which little you made for me last summer. McAlvin
refreshed it a little, and it looked most proud. Sam
Eliot, who presided, said to me, "Why, Julia, you look
like the queen that I said you were, long ago. If I could
do so, I would introduce you as the Queen." I tell you
all this in order that you may know that I was all right
as to appearance. I was to read a poem, but had not
managed to compose one, so I copied out "Our Country"
from "Later Lyrics," and read it as I was never
able to read it before. For the first time, it <i>told</i> upon
the audience. This was because it was especially appropriate
to the occasion....</p></blockquote>


<p><br />"<i>May 11.</i> Opposed the dispensing with the reading

and hear it read.' Finished my screed for this evening

which is strongly <i>reminiscent</i>, and also saw Mounet-Sully's

women, a desire to make <i>me</i> president [of the General
Federation of Women's Clubs]. This I immediately
put out of the question and Mrs. Cheney stood

<p><br />The Seventy-fifth Birthday brought the customary

<p>I send you a budget of tributes to my birthday. The
"Springfield Republican" has a bit about it, with a
good and gratifying poem from Sanborn. <i>Really</i>, dear,
between you and me what a old humbug it is! But no
matter&mdash;if people will take me for much better than
I am, I can't help it, and must only try to live up to
my reputation.... I received a good letter from you,
"a little scolding at first," but "soft rebukes with
blessings ended," as Longfellow describes the admonitions
of his first wife.... At the Suffrage Festival,
Governor Long presided, and in introducing me waved
a branch of lilies, saying, "In the beauty of the lilies
she is still, at seventy-five." Now that I call handsome,
don't you?...</p>

<p>Flossy had a very successful afternoon tea while
I was with her. She had three ladies of the <i>Civitas</i>
Club and invited about one hundred of her neighbors
to hear them read papers. It wasn't suffrage, but it
was good government, which is about the same thing.
The parlors looked very pretty. I should think seventy
or eighty came and all were delighted. Did I write
you that at Philadelphia she made the most admired
speech of the occasion? She wore the brocade, finely
made over, with big black velvet top sleeves and
rhinestone comb, and they 'plauded and 'plauded,
and I sat, grinning like a chessy cat, oh! so welly
pleased.</p></blockquote>

in town to church; desired in my mind to have some
good abiding thought given me to work for and live
by. The best thought that came to me was something
like this: we are careful of our fortune and of our reputation.
We are not careful enough of our lives. Society
is built of these lives in which each should fit his or her
place, like a stone fitly joined by the builder. We die,
but <i>the life we have lived remains</i>, and helps to build
society well or ill. Later on I thought that it sometimes
seems as if a rope or chain of mercy would be let
down to pull some of us out of sin and degradation, out
of the Hell of passion. If we have taken hold of it and
have been rescued, shall we not work to have others
drawn up with us? At such moments, I remember my
old wish to speak to the prisoners, never fully realized."</p>

Centenary, of which I have despaired; my mind has
seemed dull of late, and I have had a hard time with
this poem, writing what appeared to me bald-doggerel,
with no uniting thought. In these last three days, I
have hammered upon it, and bettered it, coming in
sight of a better vein and to-day, not without prayerful
effort, I got it about ready, <i>D.G.</i>"</p>

read to them the greater part of my play, "Hippolytus,"

to the ambitions of that time, but the audience, a

<p>Last Sunday evening I spoke in Trinity Church,
having been invited to do so by the rector, Dr. Donald.
Wonders will never cease. The meeting was in behalf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200b" id="Page_200b">[200]</a></span>
of the colored school at Tuskegee, which we A.A.W.'s
visited after our Congress. I dressed myself with unusual
care. Dr. Donald gave me the place of honor
and took me in and upon the platform in the chancel
where we all sat. Governor Greenhalge was the first
speaker. I came about fourth, and to my surprise was
distinctly heard all over the house. You may easily
imagine that I enjoyed this very much, although it
was rather an anxious moment when I stepped forward
to speak.... We are all much shocked at the death
of dear Robert Louis Stevenson of which you will

<p><br />"<i>January 1, 1895.</i> I was awake very early and

<p>"<i>January 6</i>.... My afternoon service at the Women's
Educational and Industrial Union.... The day
was very stormy and Mrs. Lee met me at the carriage,
offering to excuse me from speaking to the five persons
who were in attendance. I felt not to disappoint those
five, and presently twenty-three were present, and we
had a pleasant talk, after the reading of the short
sermon."</p>

<p>"<i>January 8</i>.... Felt much discouraged at waking,
the long vista of work opening out before me, each
task calling for some original brain-work, I mean for
some special thought worth presenting to an audience.
While I puzzled, a thought came to me for this day's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201b" id="Page_201b">[201]</a></span>
suffrage speech: 'The kingdom cometh not with observation.'
The silent, gradual, wonderful growth of
public sentiment regarding woman suffrage, the
spreading sense of the great universal harmony which
Christ delivered to us in the words and acts of a few
years, and which, it seems to me, is only now beginning
to make itself generally felt and to shape the
world's councils increasingly."</p>

<p>"<i>January 25.</i> I awoke this morning overwhelmed
by the thought of my lecture at Salem, which I have
not written. Suddenly a line of my own came to me,
'Had I one of thy words, my Master,' and this brought
me the train of thought, which I shall endeavor to
present. The one word which we all have is 'charity.'
I wrote quite a screed and with that and some speaking
shall get through, I hope.... Got a good lead of
thought and felt that I could supply <i>extempore</i> what
I had not time to write. Harry and Fanny had a
beautiful dinner for Lady Henry Somerset."</p>

<p>"<i>January 26.</i> Lunch and lecture in Salem. A dreadful
storm; I felt that I must go. The hackman and I

the shock would have been severe and even dangerous...."</p>

were badly blocked. My engagement at Brooklyn was

gave me a fine dinner. Margaret went with me, in

we must be willing to commit our dear ones to God,

as the termination of all fight and struggle, and prayed
that in the life beyond I might pay some of the debts

make good in this life. Feeling a little like my old

Alliteration is, I know, one of my weaknesses.
I thought afterwards of a third W&mdash;, work, worship,
welcome. These three words will do for a motto of the
life which I now lead, in which these words stand for
my ruling objects, 'welcome' denoting 'hospitality' in

sentiment and also intellectual truth. In Dr. Hedge's
view, the inevitable mistakes of human intellect in its
early unfolding were helpful to the development of
true sentiment. Higher than this, however, must be
the agreement of the two, prefigured perhaps in such
sentences as 'Mercy and truth have kissed each other.'

wooden tenpins as to those who were present on that
occasion.</p>

<p>"In this, I afterwards learned that I was mistaken.
After the conclusion of the evening's exercise, a young
man, well known in the community, was heard to
inquire urgently where he could find the lecturer.
Friends asked, what did he want of her? He replied:
'Well, I did put my brother in the poorhouse, and now
that I have heard Mrs. Howe, I suppose that I must
take him out.'"</p>

<p>Another personal reminiscence goes back to her
childhood days:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had a nursery governess when I was a small child.
She came from some country town, and probably regarded
her position in my father's family as a promotion.
One evening, while we little folks gathered about
her in our nursery, she wept bitterly. 'What is the
matter?' we asked; and she took me up in her lap, and
said: 'My poor old father came here to see me to-day,
and I would not see him. I bade them tell him that
he had mistaken the house, and he went away, and as
he went I saw him looking up at the windows so wistfully!'
Poor woman! We wept with her, feeling that
this was indeed a tragical event, and not knowing
what she could do to make it better.</p>

<p>"But could I see that woman now, I would say to
her: 'If you were serving the king at his table, and
held his wine-cup in your hand, and your father stood
without, asking for you, you should set down the cup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213b" id="Page_213b">[213]</a></span>
and go out from the royal presence to honor your
father, so much the more if he is poor, so much the
more if he is old.' And all that is really polite in polite
society would say so too."</p>

<p>On the same page is a memory of later years:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I once heard a lady, herself quite new in society,
say of a Parisian dame who had shown her some attention:
'Ah! the trouble with Madame &mdash;&mdash; is that
she is too good-natured. She entertains everybody.'
'Indeed,' thought I, 'if she had been less good-natured,
is it certain that she would have entertained you?'"</p>

<p>THE HOUSE OF REST</p>

<p>
I will build a house of rest,<br />
Square the corners every one:<br />
At each angle on his breast<br />
Shall a cherub take the sun;<br />
Rising, risen, sinking, down,<br />
Weaving day's unequal crown.<br />
<br />

*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />
<br />
With a free, unmeasured tread<br />
Shall we pace the cloisters through:<br />
Rest, enfranchised, like the Dead;<br />
Rest till Love be born anew.<br />
Weary Thought shall take his time,<br />
Free of task-work, loosed from rhyme.<br />
<br />
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />
<br />
Measured bread shall build us up<br />
At the hospitable board;<br />
In Contentment's golden cup<br />
Is the guileless liquor poured.<br />
May the beggar pledge the king<br />
In that spirit gathering.<br />
<br />
Oh! My house is far away;<br />
Yet it sometimes shuts me in.<br />
Imperfection mars each day<br />
While the perfect works begin.<br />
In the house of labor best<br />
Can I build the house of rest.<br />

<p><br />On the fly-leaf of the Journal for 1896 is written:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That it may please Thee, to have mercy upon all
men, we beseech Thee to hear us, Good Lord."</p>

<p>"<i>January 1.</i> I ask for this year, or for so much of
it as God may grant me, that I may do some service in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215b" id="Page_215b">[215]</a></span>
the war of civilization against barbarism, in my own
country and elsewhere."</p>

<p>"<i>January 18.</i>... Re-wrote and finished my Easter
poem, for which <i>gratias Deo</i>! I have had so much small
business that I almost despaired of accomplishing this
poem, of which the conception is good, but the execution
very faulty. I took it all to pieces to-day, kept
the thoughts and altered the arrangement."</p>

<p>"<i>January 23.</i> Dinner of Sorosis at the Waldorf, at
7 o'clock.</p>

<p>"Reached New York at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Elizabeth [Mrs. John
Jay Chapman] had sent maid and carriage for me,
which was most kind. Had a good rest and a short
walk and went to Sorosis dinner, which was very
brilliant and fine. I was asked to speak and took for
my topic, 'The Day of Small Things'; the beginning
of Sorosis and the New England Woman's Club, considered
so trifling a matter, yet very important because
it had behind it a very important principle; the
fact that the time had come in which women were
bound to study, assist, and stand by each other. I
quoted Christ's saying about the mustard seed. Miss
Barton's mission to Armenia I called a mustard seed,
and one which would have very important results."</p>

<p>"<i>January 27....</i> Wrote a few lines to Mrs. Charles
A. Babcock, Oil City, Pennsylvania, for a woman's
issue of a paper called the 'Derrick.' She wishes me
to say what I thought would be the result of the
'women's edition' fad. I said that one result would
be to drive to desperation those who receive letters,
asking contributions to these issues."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216b" id="Page_216b">[216]</a></span>"<i>February 9.</i> Another inspired sermon from C. G.
Ames. Miss Page asked, 'Why is he so earnest? What
does it mean?' I replied, 'He is in one of those waves
of inspiration which come sometimes. The angel has
certainly troubled the pool and we can go to it for
healing.' Returning home, I wrote some lines about
my sister Annie's picture. I had in church a momentary
glimpse of the meaning of Christ's saying, 'I am
the vine and ye are the branches.' I felt how the source
of our spiritual love is in the heavenly fatherhood,
and how departing from our sense of this we become
empty and barren. It was a moment of great comfort...."</p>

<p>"<i>February 10....</i> Gulesian last evening said that
the Armenians want me to go to England, as a leader
in advocacy of their cause. The thought brought me
a new feeling of energy and enthusiasm. I think I
must first help the cause in Washington, D.C."</p>

<p>"<i>February 26.</i> Hearing at State House on Suffrage.
Worked at it [her address] somewhat in the early
morning. Was tolerably successful in making my
points. Was rather disappointed because no one
applauded me. Considered that this was a lesson that
we must learn, to do without praise. It comforted
me to take it in this way. Soon the interest of what
the others said put my own matters quite out of my
mind. The hearing was a good one, all except a dreadful
woman, calling herself a Socialist, full of insufferable
conceit and affectation of knowledge. An English
labor man spoke well."</p>

<p>"<i>March 22....</i> As I left church, Mrs. James Freeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217b" id="Page_217b">[217]</a></span>
Clarke stopped me, took both of my hands in
hers and said she was sure that the world was better
for my having been in it. This from so undemonstrative
a person moved me a good deal and consoled me
somewhat for my poor deserts and performances in the
past&mdash;a burden which often weighs heavily upon
me...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 2.</i> Conservatory of Music, 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> I went in
fear and trembling with a violent bronchial cold and
cough, in a miserable storm. I prayed all the way
there that I might be pleasant in my demeanor, and
I think that I was, for my trouble at having to run
such a risk soon went out of my mind, and I enjoyed
the occasion very much; especially meeting pupils from
so many distant States, and one or two from Canada."</p>

<p>"<i>April 8....</i> I asked in my prayer this morning,
feeling miserably dull and weak, that some deed of
help and love might be given me to accomplish to-day.
At noon came three gentlemen, Hagop Bogigian, Mr.
Blanchard, and Mr. Breed, of Lynn, praying me to
make an appeal to the women of America for their
Armenian sisters, who are destroying themselves in
many instances to avoid Turkish outrage. The funds
subscribed for relief are exhausted and some new stimulus
to rouse the public is much needed.... I felt that
I had had an answer to my prayer...."</p>

this summer to intercede with Queen Victoria for the
Armenians. I thought of it, but the plan seemed to

Cretans greatly at heart, but I don't think I could do
any good in the way just mentioned. I should have

John Elliott, not as Maud Howe Elliott. Your name
is probably known there as one of the friends of "Free
Russia," and you might be subjected to some annoyance
in consequence. You had better make acquaintance
with our minister, whoever he may be. The
Russians seem now to have joined hands with the
Turks. If the American missionaries can only be got
rid of, Russia, it is said, will take Armenia under her
so-called protection, and will compel all Christians to
join the Greek Church. There is so much spying in
Russia that you will have to be very careful what you
talk about. I rather hope you will not go, for a dynamite
country is especially dangerous in times of great
public excitement, which the time of the coronation
cannot fail to be....</p></blockquote>

possible for me to get such a book ready...."</p>


<p><br />As a matter of fact, it took three years for her to
complete the "Reminiscences." During these years,
while she made it her principal literary work, it still
had to take its chance with the rest, to be laid down
at the call of the hour and taken up again when the
insistence of "screed" or poem was removed: this
while in Boston or Newport. During the Roman
winter, soon to be described, she wrote steadily day
by day; but here she must still work at disadvantage,
having no access to journals or papers, depending on
memory alone.</p>

<p>Oh, yes! you now and then do lend me a daughter,
and so you'd ought to. Which, didn't I profit by
Alice's visit? My good woman (as poor, dear &mdash;&mdash;
used to say when she was in wrath), I should think so.
Clear comfort the wretch was to me, wretch because
she had such an old miserable to look after. I sometimes
catch myself thinking that, however it may be
with other families, your family, madam, came into this
world for my especial pleasure and comfort. What
do you think of this view? No matter what you think,
dear, it won't make any difference as to facts.... I
miss even the youth in Alice's voice. I would like,
mum, if you please, mum, to enjoy about sixty years
more of grandmotherhood, with fresh crops of grandchildren
coming up at reasonable intervals. Our life
here, this summer, is even unusually quiet. We have
few visitors.... I am, as usual, well content with my
books, and busy with my papers. Flossy reads aloud
Green's "History of the English People" about half
an hour daily, after breakfast. The boys reluctantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222b" id="Page_222b">[222]</a></span>
submit to listen, fidgeting a good deal. It is less readable
for youth than I supposed it to be. We play whist
in the evening, and had a wood fire last evening, the
weather being suddenly cold. I learned yesterday,
from the "'Tiser," the death of Adolphe Mailliard [her
brother-in-law] which has brought me many sober
thoughts, despite the trifling tone of this letter. I had
waked the day before, thinking that some one said to
me "Mailliard is dying." I recorded it in my Diary,

present time seems impossible. I am sorry that I saw
so very little of him after my marriage, but he was
disposed to consider me as one of the lost, and I could
not have met him on any religious ground. I could do
this better now, having learned something of the value
which very erroneous opinions may have, when they
serve, as in his case, to stimulate right effort and true

<p><br />The year 1897 brought new activities. The Lodge
Immigration Bill roused her to indignation and protest;
there were "screeds" and letters to the powers
that were.</p>

<p>In the early spring came another crisis in the East,
Greece and Crete bearing this time the brunt of Turkish
violence. Thirty years had passed since Crete
made her first stand for independence; years of dumb
suffering and misery. Now her people rose again
in revolt against their brutal masters, and this time
Greece felt strong enough to stand openly by her
Cretan brothers.</p>

<p>Our mother was deeply moved by this new need,
which recalled so many precious memories. The record

in thinking that it is not good for either party. It is
certainly very narrowing both to the mind and to the
affections, and is therefore to be avoided. A reasonable
amount of outside intercourse is a vital condition of
good living, even in the most sympathetic and intimate

twenty-fifth anniversary. The whole thing was very
beautiful&mdash;the reception was in the tapestry room of
the Art Museum. I was placed in a sort of throne chair,
with the president and ex-presidents in a line at my
left, and the cream of Boston was all brought up and
presented to me. In another of the large rooms a
stage had been arranged, and from this I made my
little speech. Then came some beautiful singing by
Mrs. Tebbets, with a small orchestral accompaniment,
and then was given one act of Tennyson's
"Princess" and Browning's "In a Balcony." The
place, the performances, and the guests made this a
very distinguished occasion. I had gone just before
this to see Louisa Cushing's wonderful acting in a
French play of the Commune. She possesses great
tragic power and reminds one of Duse and of Sarah

<p>"<i>May 4.</i> The day was auspicious for our meeting.
Although very tired with the preparations, I wrote
my little screed, dressed, and went betimes to the
Hall, where I was expected to preside. I found it
prettily arranged, though at very small expense. I
wore as a badge a tiny Greek flag made of blue and
white ribbon, and brought badges of these colors for
the young ladies who were to take up the collection.
Many whom I had requested to come were present.
Sarah Whitman, Lizzie Agassiz, Mrs. Cornelius Felton,
Mrs. Fields, Mrs. Whitney, besides our Committee and
Mrs. Barrows. M. Anagnos gave us the band of the Institution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229b" id="Page_229b">[229]</a></span>
which was a great help. They played several
times. I introduced C. G. Ames, who made a prayer.
My opening address followed. Mmes. Livermore and
Woolson, and Anagnos made the most important addresses.
As the band played 'America,' a young Greek
came in, bearing the Greek flag, which had quite a
dramatic effect. The meeting was enthusiastic and
the contribution unusual for such a meeting, three
hundred and ninety-seven dollars and odd cents.
Thank God for this success."</p>

<p>"The Round Table was most interesting. Rev. S. J.

I think I was called next. I characterized the Turks
as almost '<i>ferae naturae</i>.' Spoke of the low level of

upon the ethical people, but hope for a general world-movement
making necessary the adoption of a higher

<p>First place, darling, dismiss from your mind the idea
that reasonable people to-day believe that the souls of
men in the pre-Christian world were condemned and
lost. The old religions are generally considered to-day
as necessary steps in the religion of the human race,
and therefore as part of the plan of a beneficent Providence.
The Jews were people of especial religious
genius, producing a wonderful religious literature, and
Christianity, which came out of Judaism, is, to my
belief, the culmination of the religious sense of mankind.
But Paul himself says, speaking to the Athenians,
that "God hath not left himself without a witness,"
at any time. I was brought up, of course, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232b" id="Page_232b">[232]</a></span>
the old belief, which I soon dismissed as irreconcilable
with any idea of a beneficent Deity. As for the doctrine
of regeneration, I think that by being born again
the dear Lord meant that we cannot apprehend spiritual
truths unless our minds are earnestly set upon
understanding them. To any one who has led a simple,
material life, without aspiration or moral reflection,
the change by which his attention becomes fastened
upon the nobler aspect of character and of life is really
like a new birth. We may say the same of the love
of high art and great literature. Some people turn
very suddenly from a frivolous or immoral life to a
better and more thoughtful way. They remember this
as a sudden conversion. In most of us, I think the
change is more gradual and natural. The better influences
win us from the evil things to which most of
us are in some way disposed. We have to seek the one
and to shun the other. I, for example, am very thankful
that my views of many things are unlike what they
were twenty or thirty or forty years ago. I attribute
this change mostly to good influences, reading, hearing
sermons and high conversation. These things often
begin in an effort of will to "move up higher." If I
write more about this, I shall muddle myself and you.
Only don't distress yourself about regeneration. I
think it mostly comes insensibly, like a child's
growth....</p>

<p>I attended the memorial meeting at the unveiling

Beacon Street. Governor Wolcott, in a barouche and

Regiment came on and marched beautifully; our
Cadets marched about as well. There was also a
squad from our battleships, two of which were in the
harbor. At twelve o'clock we all went to Music Hall
where they sang my "Battle Hymn." The Governor
and Mayor and Colonel Harry Lee spoke.
Willie James gave the oration and Booker Washington
really made <i>the</i> address of the day, simple, balanced,

suggested that the oil pictured something which could
not be given in a minute. Cited Beecher's saying,
which I have so long remembered, that we cannot get
religion as we order a suit of clothes. If we live without
it, when some overwhelming distress or temptation
meets us, we shall not find either the consolation
or the strength which true faith gives."</p>

<p>"<i>September 23.</i> Have just learned by cable from
Rome that my dearest sister Louisa died yesterday
morning. Let me rather hope that she awoke from
painful weakness and infirmity into a new glory of
spiritual life. Her life here has been most blameless,
as well as most beautiful. Transplanted to Rome in
her early youth and beauty, she became there a centre
of disinterested hospitality, of love and of charity.
She was as rare a person in her way as my sweet sister
Annie. Alas! I, of less desert than either, am left,
the last of my dear father's and mother's children. God
grant that my remaining may be for good! And God
help me to use faithfully my little remnant of life in setting
my house in order, and in giving such completeness
as I can to my life-work, or rather, to its poor efforts."</p>

my many difficulties. The day is most lovely. I

better. One is called 'The Comforter,' and was probably
written in view of the loss of friends by death.
It speaks of the spirit of a true life, which does not
pass away when the life is ended, but becomes more
and more dear and precious to loving survivors. The

<span style="margin-left: 15em;">J. W. H.</span>
</p>


<p><br />The closing verse of her early poem, "The City of
My Love," expresses the longing that, like Shelley's,
her heart "might buried lie" in Rome. Some memory
of this wish, some foreboding that the wish might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238b" id="Page_238b">[238]</a></span>
granted, possibly darkened the first days of her last
Roman winter. In late November of the year 1897
she arrived in Rome with the Elliotts to pass the
winter at their apartment in the ancient Palazzo
Rusticucci of the old Leonine City across the Tiber;
in the shadow of St. Peter's, next door to the Vatican.
The visit had been planned partly in the hope that she
might once more see her sister Louisa. In this we know
she was disappointed. They reached Rome at the beginning
of the rainy season, which fell late that year.
All these causes taken together account for an unfamiliar
depression that creeps into the Journal. She
missed, too, the thousand interests of her Boston life;
her church, her club, her meetings, all the happy business
of keeping a grandmother's house where three
generations and their friends were made welcome. At
home every hour of time was planned for, every ounce
of power well invested in some "labor worthy of her
metal." In Rome her only work at first was the writing
of her "Reminiscences" for the "Atlantic Monthly."
Happily, the depression was short-lived. Gradually
the ancient spell of the Great Enchantress once more
enthralled her, but it was not until she had founded a
club, helped to found a Woman's Council, begun to
receive invitations to lecture and to preach, that the
accustomed <i>joie de vivre</i> pulses through the record.
The sower is at work again, the ground is fertile, the
seed quickening.</p>


<p><br />"<i>December 1.</i> The first day of this winter, which
God help me to live through! Dearest Maud is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239b" id="Page_239b">[239]</a></span>
kindness and devotion to me, and so is Jack, but I
have Rome <i>en grippe</i>; nothing in it pleases me."</p>

<p>"<i>December 6.</i> Something, perhaps it is the bright
weather, moves me to activity so strongly that I hasten
to take up my pen, hoping not to lapse into the
mood of passive depression which has possessed me
ever since my arrival in Rome."</p>

<p>"<i>December 7.</i> We visited the [William J.] Stillmans&mdash;S.
and I had not met in thirty years, not since '67
in Athens. Went to afternoon tea at Miss Leigh
Smith's. She is a cousin of Florence Nightingale,
whom she resembles in appearance. Mme. Helbig
was there, overflowing as ever with geniality and
kindness."</p>


<p><br />Mr. Stillman was then the Roman correspondent of
the London "Times," a position only second in importance
to that of the British Ambassador. His tall, lean
figure, stooping shoulders,&mdash;where a pet squirrel often
perched,&mdash;his long grey beard and keen eyes were
familiar to the Romans of that day. His house was a
meeting-place for artists and <i>litterati</i>. Mrs. Stillman
our mother had formerly known as the beautiful Marie
Spartali, the friend of Rossetti and Du Maurier, the
idol of literary and artistic London. A warm friendship
grew up between them. Together they frequented
the antiquaries, gleaning small treasures of ancient
lace and peasant jewels.</p>

<p>"I bought this by the Muse Stillman's advice":
this explanation guaranteed the wisdom of purchasing
the small rose diamond ring set in black enamel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240b" id="Page_240b">[240]</a></span>"<i>December 9.</i> Dined with Daisy Chanler. We met
there one Brewster and Hendrik Anderson. After
dinner came Palmer [son of Courtland] and his sister.
He is a pianist of real power and charm&mdash;made me
think of Paderewski, when I first heard him...."</p>

<p>"<i>December 10.</i> Drove past the Trevi Fountain and
to the Coliseum, where we walked awhile. Ladies
came to hear me talk about Women's Clubs. This
talk, which I had rather dreaded to give, passed off
pleasantly.... Most of the ladies present expressed
the desire to have a small and select club of women
in Rome. Maud volunteered to make the first effort,
with Mme. DesGrange and Jessie Cochrane to help
her."</p>

<p>"<i>December 12.</i> Bessie Crawford brought her children
to see me. Very fine little creatures, the eldest boy<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
handsome, dark like his mother, the others blond and
a good deal like Marion in his early life."</p>

<p>"<i>December 14.</i> In the afternoon drove with Jack to
visit Villegas. Found a splendid house with absolutely
no fire&mdash;the cold of the studio was tomb-like. A fire
was lighted in a stove and cakes were served, with
some excellent Amontillado wine, which I think saved
my life."</p>

<p>"<i>December 18.</i> When I lay down to take my nap
before dinner, I had a sudden thought-vision of the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. I seemed to
see how the human could in a way reflect the glory
of the divine, giving not a mechanical, but an affectional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241b" id="Page_241b">[241]</a></span>
and spiritual re-showing of the great unfathomable
glory. I need not say that I had no sleep&mdash;I
wish the glimpse then given me might remain in my
mind."</p>

<p>"<i>December 21.</i> Feeling much better in health, I
determined to take up my 'Reminiscences' again.
Mme. Rose passed the evening with me. She told me
that Pio Nono had endorsed the Rosminian philosophy,
which had had quite a following in the Church,
Cardinal Hohenlohe having been very prominent in
this. When Leo XIII was elected, the Jesuits came
to him and promised that he should have a Jubilee if
he would take part against the Rosminian ideas, and
put the books on the Index Expurgatorius, the which
he promptly did. Hohenlohe is supposed to have been
the real hero of the poisoning described in Zola's
'Rome'&mdash;his servant died after having eaten of something
which had been sent from the Vatican."</p>

<p>"<i>December 25.</i> Blessed Christmas Day! Maud and
I went to St. Peter's to get, as she said, a whiff of the
mass. We did not profit much by this, but met Edward
Jackson, of Boston, and Monsignor Stanley, whom I
had not seen in many years. We had a pleasant foregathering
with him.</p>

<p>"In St. Peter's my mind became impressed with
the immense intellectual force pledged to the upbuilding
and upholding of the Church of Rome. As this
thought almost overpowered me, I remembered our
dear Christ visiting the superb temple at Jerusalem
and foretelling its destruction and the indestructibility
of his own doctrine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242b" id="Page_242b">[242]</a></span>On fair days she took her walk on the terrace, feasting
her eyes on the splendid view. In the distance the
Alban and the Sabine Hills, Mount Soracte and the
Leonessa; close at hand the Tiber, Rome's towers and
domes, St. Peter's with the colonnade, the Piazza, and
the sparkling fountains. She delighted in the flowers of
the terrace, which she called her "hanging garden"; she
had her own little watering-pot, and faithfully tended
the white rose which she claimed as her special charge.
From the terrace she looked across to the windows of
the Pope's private apartment. Opposed as she was
to the Pontiff's policy, she still felt a sympathy with
the old man, whose splendid prison she often passed
on her way to St. Peter's, where in bad weather she
always took her walk.</p>

<p>"<i>December 31.</i> I am sorry to take leave of this year,
which has given me many good things, some blessings
in disguise, as my lameness proved, compelling me
to pass many quiet days, good for study and for my
'Reminiscences,' which I only began in earnest after
Wesselhoeft condemned me to remain on one floor for
a month."</p>

<p>"<i>January 3, 1898.</i> I feel that my 'Reminiscences'
will be disappointing to the world in general, if it ever
troubles itself to read them,&mdash;I feel quite sure that
it has neglected some good writing of mine, in verse
and in prose. I cannot help anticipating for this book
the same neglect, and this discourages me somewhat.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon drove to Monte Janiculo and
saw the wonderful view of Rome, and the equestrian
statue of Garibaldi crowning the height. We also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243b" id="Page_243b">[243]</a></span>
drove through the Villa Pamfili Doria, which is very
beautiful."</p>

<p>"<i>January 6.</i> To visit Countess Catucci at Villino
Catucci. She was a Miss Mary Stearns, of Springfield,
Massachusetts. Her husband has been an officer
of the King's bersaglieri. Before the unification of
Italy, he was sent to Perugia to reclaim deserters from
among the recruits for the Italian army. Cardinal
Pecci was then living near Perugia. Count Catucci
called to assure him with great politeness that he
would take his word and not search his premises. The
Cardinal treated him with equal politeness, but declined
to continue the acquaintance after his removal
to Rome, when he became Pope in 1878."</p>

<p>"<i>January 12.</i> The first meeting of our little circle&mdash;at
Miss Leigh Smith's, 17 Trinità dei Monti. I presided
and introduced Richard Norton, who gave an
interesting account of the American School of Archæology
at Athens, and of the excavations at Athens....
Anderson to dine. He took a paper outline of my profile,
wishing to model a bust of me."</p>


<p><br />The Winthrop Chanlers were passing the winter in
Rome; this added much to her pleasure. The depression
gradually disappeared, and she found herself
once more at home there. She met many people
who interested her: Hall Caine, Björnstjerne Björnson,
many artists too. Don José Villegas, the great
Spanish painter (now Director of the Prado Museum
at Madrid), who was living in his famous Moorish
villa on the Monte Parioli, made a brilliant, realistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244b" id="Page_244b">[244]</a></span>
portrait of her, and Hendrik Anderson, the Norwegian-American
sculptor, modelled an interesting terra-cotta
bust. While the sittings for these portraits were going
on, her niece said to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My aunt, I can expect almost anything of you, but
I had hardly expected a <i>succès de beauté</i>."</p>

<p>Among the diplomats who play so prominent a part
in Roman society, the Jonkheer John Loudon, Secretary
of the Netherlands Legation, was one of her favorite
visitors; there are frequent mentions of his singing,
which she took pleasure in accompanying.</p>

<p>"<i>January 15.</i> We had a pleasant drive to Villa
Madama where we bought fresh eggs from a peasant.
Cola cut much greenery for us with which Maud had
our rooms decorated. Attended Mrs. Heywood's reception,
where met some pleasant people&mdash;the Scudder
party; an English Catholic named Christmas, who
visits the poor, and reports the misery among them as
very great; a young priest from Boston, Monsignor
O'Connell;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> a Mr. and Mrs. Mulhorn, Irish,&mdash;he
strong on statistics, she a writer on Celtic antiquities,&mdash;has
published a paper on the Celtic origin of the
'Divina Commedia,' and has written one on the discovery
of America by Irish Danes, five hundred years
before Columbus."</p>


<p><br />Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Heywood lived a few doors from
the Rusticucci in the Palazzo Giraud Torlonia, one
of the finest Roman palaces. Mr. Heywood held an
office in the Papal Court, and had a papal title which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245b" id="Page_245b">[245]</a></span>
he was wise enough not to use in general society. He
was an American, a Harvard graduate of the class of
1855. His chief occupation, outside of his duties at the
Vatican, was the collection of a fine library. His house
was a rendezvous of Black<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> society. He lived in much
state and entertained with brilliant formality. Among
the great social events of that winter was his reception
given for Cardinal Satolli, who arrived dressed in
splendid vestments, escorted by his suite. The hostess
courtesied to the ground and kissed the ring on his
finger. All the other Catholic ladies followed suit.
Sitting very straight in her chair, our mother bided her
time; finally the Cardinal was brought to her. He was
a genial, courteous man and very soon they were
deep in friendly talk. Though she disliked the Roman
hierarchy as an institution, she counted many friends
among the priests of Rome.</p>

<p>"<i>January 18.</i> To St. Peter's. The Festival of St.
Peter's Chair. Vespers in the usual side chapel. Music
on the whole good, some sopranos rather ragged, but
parts beautifully sung. Was impressed as usual by the
heterogeneous attendance&mdash;tourists with campstools
and without, ecclesiastics of various grades, students,
friars; one splendid working-man in his corduroys
stood like a statue, in an attitude of fixed attention.
Lowly fathers and mothers carrying small children.
One lady, seated high at the base of a column, put her
feet on the seat of my stool behind me. Saw the gorgeous
ring on the finger of the statue of St. Peter."</p>

<p>"<i>January 19.</i> Have composed a letter to Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246b" id="Page_246b">[246]</a></span>
Lanciani, asking for a talk on the afternoon of February
9, proposing 'Houses and Housekeeping in Ancient
Rome,' and 'The Sibyls of Italy.' Mr. Baddeley came
in, and we had an interesting talk, mostly about the
ancient Cæsars, Mrs. Hollins asking, 'Why did the Romans
put up with the bad Cæsars?' He thought the
increase of wealth under Augustus was the beginning
of a great deterioration of the people and the officials."</p>

<p>"<i>January 21.</i> Went in the afternoon to call upon
Baroness Giacchetti. Had a pleasant talk with her
husband, an enlightened man. He recognizes the present
status of Rome as greatly superior to the ancient
order of things&mdash;but laments the ignorance and superstition
of the common people in general, and the
peasantry in particular. A sick woman, restored to
health by much trouble taken at his instance, instead
of thanking him for his benefactions, told him that
she intended to make a pilgrimage to the shrine of a
certain Madonna, feeling sure that it was to her that
she owed her cure."</p>

<p>"<i>January 26.</i> The day of my reading before the
Club, at Jessie Cochrane's rooms. I read my lecture
over very carefully in the forenoon and got into the
spirit of it. The gathering was a large one, very attentive,
and mostly very appreciative. The paper was
'Woman in the Greek Drama.'"</p>

<p>"<i>January 31.</i> Have made a special prayer that my
mind may be less occupied with my own shortcomings,
and more with all that keeps our best hope alive. Felt
little able to write, but produced a good page on the
principle '<i>nulla dies sine linea</i>.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247b" id="Page_247b">[247]</a></span>"<i>February 4.</i> Hard sledding for words to-day&mdash;made
out something about Theodore Parker."</p>

<p>"<i>February 7.</i> Wrote some pages of introduction for
the Symposium&mdash;played a rubber of whist with
L. Terry; then to afternoon tea with Mrs. Thorndike,
where I met the first Monsignor [Dennis] O'Connell,
with whom I had a long talk on the woman question,
in which he seems much interested. He tells me of
a friend, Zahm by name, now gone to a place in Indiana,
who has biographies of the historical women of
Bologna."</p>

<p>"<i>February 9.</i> Club at Mrs. Broadwood's. I read my
'Plea for Humor,' which seemed to please the audience
very much, especially Princess Talleyrand and Princess
Poggia-Suasa."</p>

<p>"<i>February 11.</i> Read over my paper on 'Optimism
and Pessimism' and have got into the spirit of it.
Maud's friends came at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, among them Christian
Ross, the painter, with Björnstjerne Björnson."</p>

<p>"<i>February 16.</i> To Mrs. Hurlburt's reception.&mdash;Talked
with Countess Blank, an American married to
a Pole. She had much to say of the piety of her Arab
servant, who, she says, swallows fire, cuts himself with
sharp things, etc., as acts of devotion!! Met Mr.
Trench, son of the late Archbishop, Rev. Chevenix
Trench. He has been Tennyson's publisher. Did not
like T. personally&mdash;said he was often rude&mdash;read
his own poems aloud constantly and very badly; said,
'No man is a hero to his publisher.' Told about his
sale of Henry George's book, a cheap edition, one
hundred and fifty thousand copies sold in England."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248b" id="Page_248b">[248]</a></span>"<i>February 18.</i> Have done a good morning's work
and read in the 'Nineteenth Century' an article on
Nelson, and one on the new astronomy. St. Thomas
Aquinas's advice regarding the election of an abbot
from three candidates:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What manner of man is the first?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Doctissimus.</i>'</p>

<p>"'<i>Doceat</i>,' says St. Thomas. 'And the second?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Sanctissimus.</i>'</p>

<p>"'<i>Oret!</i> and the third?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Prudentissimus!</i>'</p>

<p>"'<i>Regat!</i> Let him rule!' says the Saint."</p>

<p>"<i>February 20.</i> To Methodist Church of Rev. Mr.
Burt. A sensible short discourse&mdash;seems a very sincere
man: has an earlier service for Italians, well
attended. On my way home, stopped at Gargiulo's
and bought a ragged but very good copy of the
'Divina Commedia,' unbound, with Doré's illustrations."</p>

<p>"<i>February 26.</i> To tea at Mrs. Hazeltine's where met
William Allen Butler, author of 'Nothing to Wear'&mdash;a
bright-eyed, conversable man. Have a sitting to
Anderson. When I returned from Mrs. Hazeltine's I
found Hall Caine.... He told much about Gabriel
Rossetti, with whom he had much to do. Rossetti was
a victim of chloral, and Caine was set to keep him
from it, except in discreet doses."</p>

<p>"<i>March 4.</i> Went to see the King and Queen, returning
from the review of troops. They were coldly
received. She wore crimson velvet&mdash;he was on horseback
and in uniform...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249b" id="Page_249b">[249]</a></span>"<i>March 9.</i> Club at Jessie Cochrane's; young Loyson,
son of Père Hyacinthe, gave an interesting lecture on
the religion of Ancient Rome, which he traced back to
its rude Latin beginning; the Sabines, he thought, introduced
into it one element of spirituality. Its mythology
was borrowed from Greece and from the Etruscans&mdash;later
from Egypt and the East. The Primitive
Aryan religion was the worship of ancestors. This also
we see in Rome. A belief in immortality appears in
the true Aryan faith. Man, finding himself human,
and related to the divine, felt that he could not die."</p>

<p>"<i>March 15</i>.... Mme. Helbig gave us an account of
the Russian pilgrimage which came here lately. Many
of the pilgrims were peasants. They travelled from
Russia on foot, wearing bark shoes, which are very
yielding and soft. These Russian ladies deprecated the
action of Peter the Great in building St. Petersburg,
and in forcing European civilization upon his nation,
when still unprepared for it."</p>

<p>"<i>March 18</i>.... Drove with Maud, to get white
thorn from Villa Madama. Went afterwards to Mrs.
Waldo Story's reception, where met Mrs. McTavish,
youngest daughter of General Winfield Scott. I was
at school with one of her older sisters, Virginia, who
became a nun."</p>


<p><br />As the winter wore away and the early Roman
spring broke, the last vestige of the discomfort of the
first weeks vanished. The daily drives to the country
in search of wild flowers were an endless delight, as
well as the trips to the older quarters of the city. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250b" id="Page_250b">[250]</a></span>
found that, while during the first weeks she had lost
the habit of looking keenly about at the sights, the old
joy soon came back to her, and now she was quick to
see every picturesque figure in the crowd, every classic
fragment in the architecture. "The power of seeing
beautiful things, like all other powers, must be exercised
to be preserved," she once said.</p>

<p>"<i>March 19.</i> I have not dared to work to-day, as I
am to read this afternoon. The reading was well attended
and was more than well received. Hall Caine
came afterwards, and talked long about the Bible. He
does not appear to be familiar with the most recent
criticism of either Old or New Testament."</p>

<p>"<i>March 24.</i> 'There is a third silent party to all our
bargains.' [Emerson.]</p>

<p>"I find this passage in his essay on 'Compensation'
to-day for the first time, having written my essay on
'Moral Triangulation of the Third Party' some thirty
years ago."</p>

<p>"<i>March 26.</i> Dined with Mrs. McCreary&mdash;the Duke
of San Martino took me in to dinner&mdash;Monsignor
Dennis O'Connell sat on the other side of me. I had
an interesting talk with him. Mrs. McCreary sang my
'Battle Hymn.' They begged me to recite 'The Flag,'
which I did. Mrs. Pearse, daughter of Mario and
Grisi, sang delightfully."</p>

<p>"<i>March 30.</i> A fine luncheon party given by Mrs.
Iddings, wife of the American Secretary of Embassy
at the Grand Hotel. Mme. Ristori was there; I had
some glimpses of reminiscence with her. I met her
with 'La terribil' Medea,' which I so well remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251b" id="Page_251b">[251]</a></span>
hearing from her. I presently quoted her toast in 'La
Locandiera,' of which she repeated the last two lines.
Maud had arranged to have Mrs. Hurlburt help me
home. Contessa Spinola also offered, but I got off
alone, came home in time to hear most of Professor
Pansotti's lecture on the Gregorian music, which,
though technical, was interesting."</p>

<p>"<i>March 31.</i> I woke up at one, after vividly dreaming
of my father and Dr. Francis. My father came in,
and said to me that he wished to speak to Miss Julia
alone. I trembled, as I so often did, lest I was about
to receive some well-merited rebuke. He said that he
wished my sister and me to stay at home more. I saw
the two faces very clearly. My father's I had not seen
for fifty-nine years."</p>

<p>"<i>April 6.</i> Went in the afternoon with Mrs. Stillman
to the Campo dei Fiori, where bought two pieces of
lace for twenty <i>lire</i> each, and a little cap-pin for five
<i>lire</i>. Saw a small ruby and diamond ring which I very
much fancied."</p>

<p>"<i>April 10.</i> Easter Sunday, passed quietly at home.
Had an early walk on the terrace.... A good talk with
Hamilton Aïdé, who told me of the Spartali family.
In the afternoon to Lady Kenmare's reception and
later to dine with the Lindall Winthrops."</p>

<p>"<i>April 11.</i> In the afternoon Harriet Monroe, of
Chicago, came and read her play&mdash;a parlor drama,
ingenious and well written. The audience were much
pleased with it."</p>

<p>"<i>April 13</i>.... In the evening dined with Theodore
Davis and Mrs. Andrews. Davis showed us his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252b" id="Page_252b">[252]</a></span>
treasures gathered on the Nile shore and gave me a
scarab."</p>

<p>"<i>April 18.</i>... Went to hear Canon Farrar on the
'Inferno' of Dante&mdash;the lecture very scholarly and
good."</p>

<p>"<i>April 22.</i> With Anderson to the Vatican, to see
the Pinturicchio frescoes, which are very interesting.
He designed the tiling for the floors, which is beautiful
in color, matching well with the frescoes&mdash;these
represent scenes in the life of the Virgin and of St.
Catherine...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 24.</i> To Miss Leigh Smith's, where I read my
sermon on the 'Still Small Voice' to a small company
of friends, explaining that it was written in the first
instance for the Concord Prison, and that I read it
there to the convicts. I prefaced the sermon by reading
one of the parables in my 'Later Lyrics,' 'Once,
where men of high pretension,' etc...."</p>

<p>This was one of several occasions when she read a
sermon at the house of Miss Leigh Smith, a stanch
Unitarian, who lived at the Trinità de' Monti in the
house near the top of the Spanish Steps, held by generations
of English and American residents the most
advantageous dwelling in Rome. On Sunday mornings,
when the bells of Rome thrilled the air with the
call to prayer, a group of exiles from many lands
gathered in the pleasant English-looking drawing-room.
From the windows they could look down
upon the flower-decked Piazza di Spagna, hear the
song of the nightingales in the Villa Medici, breathe
the perfume of violets and almond blossoms from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253b" id="Page_253b">[253]</a></span>
the Pincio. This morning, or another, Paul Sabatier
was among the listeners, a grave, gracious man, a
Savoyard pastor, whose "Life of Saint Francis of
Assisi" had set all Rome talking.</p>

<p>"<i>April 25.</i> To lunch with the Drapers. Had some
good talk with Mr. D. [the American Ambassador].
He was brought up at Hopedale in the Community,
of which his father was a member, his mother not
altogether acquiescing. He went into our Civil War
when only twenty years of age, having the day before
married a wife. He was badly wounded in the battle
of the Wilderness. Mosby [guerilla] met the wounded
train, and stripped them of money and watches, taking
also the horses of their conveyances. A young
Irish lad of fourteen saved Draper's life by running to
Bull Plain for aid."</p>

<p>"<i>April 26.</i> Lunch at Daisy Chanler's, to meet Mrs.
Sanford, of Hamilton, Canada, who is here in the
interests of the International Council of Women. She
seems a nice, whole-souled woman.... I have promised
to preside at a meeting, called at Daisy's rooms for
Thursday, to carry forward such measures as we can
and to introduce Mrs. Sanford and interpret for her."</p>

<p>"<i>April 27.</i> Devoted the forenoon to a composition in
French, setting forth the objects of the meeting...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 28.</i> Went carefully over my French address.
In the afternoon attended the meeting at Daisy's
where I presided."</p>

<p>This was the first time the Italian women had taken
part in the International Council.</p>

<p>"<i>April 30.</i> To Contessa di Taverna at Palazzo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254b" id="Page_254b">[254]</a></span>
Gabrielli, where I met the little knot of newly elected
officers of the Council of Italian Women that is to
be. Read them my report of our first meeting&mdash;they
chattered a great deal. Mrs. Sanford was present.
She seemed grateful for the help I had tried to give to
her plan of a National Council of Italian Women. I
induced the ladies present to subscribe a few <i>lire</i> each,
for the purchase of a book for the secretary, for postage
and for the printing of their small circular. Hope to
help them more further on...."</p>

<p>"<i>May 1.</i>... I gave my 'Rest' sermon at Miss
Leigh Smith's.... Afterwards to lunch with the dear
Stillman Muse. Lady Airlie and the Thynne sisters
were there. Had a pleasant talk with Lady Beatrice....
Wrote a letter to be read at the Suffrage Festival
in Boston on May 17...."</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice and Lady Katherine Thynne; the
latter was married later to Lord Cromer, Viceroy of
Egypt. The Ladies Thynne were passing the winter
with their cousin, the Countess of Kenmare, at her
pleasant apartment in the Via Gregoriana. Among
the guests one met at Lady Kenmare's was a dark,
handsome Monsignore who spoke English like an
Oxford Don, and looked like a Torquemada. Later
he became Papal Secretary of State and Cardinal
Merry del Val.</p>

<p>"<i>May 2.</i> Have worked as usual. A pleasant late
drive. Dined with Eleutherio,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Daisy Chanler, and
Dr. Bull; whist afterwards; news of an engagement
and victory for us off Manila."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255b" id="Page_255b">[255]</a></span>
"<i>May 4</i>.... We dined with Marchese and Marchesa
de Viti de Marco at Palazzo Orsini. Their rooms
are very fine, one hung with beautiful crimson damask.
An author, Pascarello, was present, who has written
comic poems in the Romanesque dialect, the principal
one a mock narrative of the discovery of America by
Columbus. Our host is a very intelligent man, much
occupied with questions of political economy, of which
science he is professor at the Collegio Romano. His
wife, an American, is altogether pleasing. He spoke
of the present Spanish War, of which foreigners understand
but little."</p>

<p>"<i>May 5.</i> A visit from Contessa di Taverna to confer
with me about the new departure [the International
Council of Women]. She says that the ladies will not
promise to pay the stipulated contribution, five hundred
<i>lire</i> once in five years, to the parent association...."</p>

<p>"<i>May 8.</i> An exquisite hour with dear Maud on the
terrace&mdash;the roses in their glory, red, white, and yellow;
honeysuckle out, brilliant. We sat in a sheltered
spot, talked of things present and to come. Robert
Collyer to lunch. I asked him to say grace, which
he did in his lovely manner. He enjoyed Maud's
terrace with views of St. Peter's and the mountains.
In the afternoon took a little drive.</p>

<p>"Several visitors called, among them Louisa Broadwood,
from whom I learned that the little Committee
for a Woman's Council is going on. The ladies have
decided not to join the International at present, but
to try and form an Italian Council first. Some good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256b" id="Page_256b">[256]</a></span>
results are already beginning to appear in the coöperation
of two separate charities in some part of their
work."</p>

<p>"<i>May 9.</i> I must now give all diligence to my preparation
for departure. Cannot write more on 'Reminiscences'
until I reach home. Maud made a dead set
against my going to Countess Resse's where a number
of ladies had been invited to meet me. I most unwillingly
gave up this one opportunity of helping the
Woman's Cause; I mean this one remaining occasion,
as I have already spoken twice to women and have
given two sermons and read lectures five times. It
is true that there might have been some exposure in
going to Mme. R.'s, especially in coming out after
speaking."</p>

<p>A few years after this, the Association which she
did so much to found, held the first Woman's Congress
ever given in Italy, at the Palace of Justice in Rome.
It was an important and admirably conducted convention.
The work for the uplift of the sex is going
on steadily and well in Italy to-day.</p>

<p>"<i>May 12.</i> Sat to Villegas all forenoon. Had a little
time on the terrace. Thought I would christen it the
'Praise God.' The flowers seem to me to hold their
silent high mass, swinging their own censers of sweet
incense. Went to Jack's studio and saw his splendid
work.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In the afternoon went with my brother-in-law
to the cemetery to visit dear Louisa's grave. Jack had
cut for me many fine roses from the terrace. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257b" id="Page_257b">[257]</a></span>
dropped many on this dear resting-place of one much
and justly beloved.... Dear old Majesty of Rome,
this is my last writing here. I thank God most earnestly
for so much."</p>

<p>HUMANITY</p>

<p>
Methought a moment that I stood<br />
Where hung the Christ upon the Cross,<br />
Just when mankind had writ in blood<br />
The record of its dearest loss.<br />
<br />
The bitter drink men offered him<br />
His kingly gesture did decline,<br />
And my heart sought, in musing dim,<br />
Some cordial for those lips divine.<br />
<br />
When lo! a cup of purest gold<br />
My trembling fingers did uphold;<br />
Within it glowed a wine as red<br />
As hearts, not grapes, its drops had shed.<br />
Drink deep, my Christ, I offer thee<br />
The ransom of Humanity.<br />

<blockquote><p>Though Jesus, alas! is as little understood in doctrine as followed in
example. For he has hitherto been like a beautiful figure set to point out
a certain way, and people at large have been so entranced with worshipping
the figure, that they have neglected to follow the direction it indicates.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">J. W. H.</span>
</p></blockquote>


<p><br />The winter of 1898-99 saw the publication of "From
Sunset Ridge; Poems Old and New." This volume
contained many of the poems from "Later Lyrics"
(long out of print), and also much of her later work.
It met with a warm recognition which gave her much
pleasure.</p>

<p>Late in 1899 appeared the "Reminiscences," on
which she had been so long at work. These were even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259b" id="Page_259b">[259]</a></span>
more warmly received, though many people thought
them too short. Colonel Higginson said the work
might have been "spread out into three or four interesting
octavos; but in her hurried grasp it is squeezed
into one volume, where groups of delightful interviews
with heroes at home and abroad are crowded into
some single sentence."</p>

<p>The book was written mostly from memory, with
little use of the Journals, and none of the family letters
and papers, which she had carefully preserved through
many years; she needed none of these things. Her past
was always alive, and she went hand in hand with its
dear and gracious figures.</p>

<p>But we have outstripped the Journals and must go
back to the beginning of 1899.</p>

<p>"[<i>Boston.</i>] <i>January 1, 1899.</i> I begin this year with
an anxious mind. I am fighting the Wolf, hand to
hand. I am also confused between the work already
done on my 'Reminiscences,' and that still wanting
to give them some completeness. May the All-Father
help me!"</p>

<p>"<i>January 9.</i> Dined with the Massachusetts Press
Club Association. I made a little speech partly
thought out beforehand. The best bit in it&mdash;'Why
should we fear to pass from the Old Testament of our
own liberties, to the New Testament of liberty for all
the world?'&mdash;came to me on the spur of the moment...."</p>

<p>"<i>January 16.</i> ... Dickens Party at the New England
Woman's Club. I despaired of being able to go,
but did manage to get up a costume and take part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260b" id="Page_260b">[260]</a></span>
Many very comical travesties, those of Pickwick and
Captain Cuttle remarkably good; also Lucia M. Peabody
as Martin Chuzzlewit, and Mrs. Godding in full
male dress suit. I played a Virginia reel and finally
danced myself."</p>

<p>The part she herself took on this occasion was that
of Mrs. Jellyby, a character she professed to resemble.
At another club party she impersonated Mrs. Jarley,
with a fine collection of celebrities, which she exhibited
proudly. She always put on her best motley
for her "dear Club"; and in those days its fooling
was no less notable than its wisdom. Among other
things, she instituted the Poetical Picnics, picnic suppers
to which every member must bring an original
poem: some of her best nonsense was recited at these
suppers.</p>

<p>It has been said that she had the gift of the word
in season. This was often shown at the Club; especially
when, as sometimes happened, a question of
the hour threatened to become "burning." It is remembered
how one day a zealous sister thundered so
loud against corporal punishment that some mothers
and grandames were roused to equally ardent rejoinder.
The President was appealed to.</p>

<p>"<i>Dear</i> Mrs. Howe, I am sure that <i>you</i> never laid a
hand on <i>your</i> children!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said dear Mrs. Howe. "I cuffed 'em a
bit when I thought they needed it!"</p>

<p>Even "militancy" could be touched lightly by her.
Talk was running high on the subject one day; eyes
began to flash ominously, voices took on "a wire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261b" id="Page_261b">[261]</a></span>
edge," as she expressed it. Again the appeal was
made.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine, Mrs. Howe, under <i>any</i> circumstances&mdash;"</p>

<p>The twinkle came into the gray eyes. "Well!" she
said. "I am pretty old, but I <i>think</i> I could manage
a broomstick!"</p>

<p>The tension broke in laughter, and the sisters were
sisters once more.</p>

<p>"<i>January 23.</i> Worked as usual. Attended the meeting
in favor of the Abolition of the Death Penalty,
which was interesting.... I spoke on the ground of
hope."</p>

<p>"<i>February 7.</i> ... I hope to take life more easily
now than for some time past, and to have rest from
the slavery of pen and ink."</p>

<p>"<i>February 28.</i> ... Was interviewed by a Miss X,
who has persevered in trying to see me, and at last
brought a note from &mdash;&mdash;. She is part editor of a
magazine named 'Success,' and, having effected an
entrance, proceeded to interview me, taking down my
words for her magazine, thus getting my ideas without
payment, a very mean proceeding...."</p>

<p>"<i>March 21.</i> Tuskegee benefit, Hollis Street Theatre.</p>

<p>"This meeting scored a triumph, not only for the
performers, but for the race. Bishop Lawrence presided
with much good grace and appreciation. Paul
Dunbar was the least distinct. Professor Dubois, of
Atlanta University, read a fine and finished discourse.
Booker Washington was eloquent as usual, and the
Hampton quartet was delightful. At the tea which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262b" id="Page_262b">[262]</a></span>
followed at Mrs. Whitman's studio, I spoke with these
men and with Dunbar's wife, a nearly white woman
of refined appearance. I asked Dubois about the
negro vote in the South. He thought it better to have
it legally taken away than legally nullified."</p>

<p>"<i>April 17.</i> Kindergarten for the Blind.... I hoped
for a good word to say, but could only think of Shakespeare's
'The evil that men do lives after them; the
good is oft interred with their bones,' intending to
say that this does not commend itself to me as true.
Mr. Eels spoke before me and gave me an occasion
to use this with more point than I had hoped. He
made a rather flowery discourse, and eulogized Annie
Sullivan and Helen Keller as a new experience in
human society. In order to show how the good that
men do survives them, I referred to Dr. Howe's first
efforts for the blind and to his teaching of Laura
Bridgman, upon whom I dwelt somewhat...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 23.</i>... Had a sort of dream-vision of the
dear Christ going through Beacon Street in shadow,
and then in his glory. It was only a flash of a moment's
thought...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 25.</i> To Alliance, the last meeting of the
season. Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; spoke, laying the greatest emphasis
on women acting so as to <i>express themselves in
freedom</i>. This ideal of self-expression appears to me
insufficient and dangerous, if taken by itself. I mentioned
its insufficiency, while recognizing its importance.
I compared feminine action under the old
limitations to the touching of an electric eel, which
immediately gives one a paralyzing shock. I spoke also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263b" id="Page_263b">[263]</a></span>
of the new woman world as at present constituted, as
like the rising up from the sea of a new continent. In
my own youth women were isolated from each other
by the very intensity of their personal consciousness.
I thought of myself and of other women in this way.
We thought that superior women ought to have been
born men. A blessed change is that which we have
witnessed."</p>


<p><br />As her eightieth birthday drew nigh, her friends
vied with one another in loving observance of the
time. The festivities began May 17 with a meeting of
the New England Women's Press Association, where
she gave a lecture on "Patriotism in Literature" and
received "eighty beautiful pink roses for my eighty
years."</p>

<p>Next came the "annual meeting and lunch of the
New England Woman's Club. This took the character
of a pre-celebration of my eightieth birthday,
and was highly honorific. I can only say that I do
not think of myself as the speakers seemed to think
of me. Too deeply do I regret my seasons of rebellion,
and my shortcomings in many duties. Yet am I
thankful for so much good-will. I only deserve it
because I return it."</p>

<p>Between this and the day itself came a memorial
meeting in honor of the ninety-sixth anniversary of
Emerson's birth. Here she spoke "mostly of the ladies
of his family"&mdash;Emerson's mother and his wife. Said
also, "Emerson was as great in what he did not say as
in what he said. Second-class talent tells the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264b" id="Page_264b">[264]</a></span>
story, reasons everything out; great genius suggests
even more than it says."</p>

<p>She was already what she used to call "Boston's
old spoiled child!" All through the birthday flowers,
letters, and telegrams poured into the house. From
among the tokens of love and reverence may be chosen
the quatrain sent by Richard Watson Gilder:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"How few have rounded out so full a life!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Priestess of righteous war and holy peace,</span><br />
Poet and sage, friend, sister, mother, wife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Long be it ere that noble heart shall cease!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>The "Woman's Journal" issued a special Birthday
number. It was a lovely and heart-warming anniversary,
the pleasure of which long remained with
her.</p>

<p>Among the guests was the beloved physician of many
years, William P. Wesselhoeft. Looking round on the
thronged and flower-decked rooms, he said, "This is
all very fine, Mrs. Howe; but on your ninetieth birthday
I shall come, and <i>nobody else</i>!" Alas! before
that day the lion voice was silent, the cordial presence
gone.</p>

<p>Three days later came an occasion which stirred
patriotic Boston to its depths. The veterans of the
Grand Army of the Republic had invited Major-General
Joseph Wheeler to deliver the Memorial Day
oration in Boston Theatre. Our mother was the second
guest of honor. She has nothing to say of this occasion
beyond the fact that she "had a great time in the
morning," and that in the open carriage with her
sat "General Wheeler's two daughters&mdash;<i>very</i> pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265b" id="Page_265b">[265]</a></span>
girls"; but pasted in the Journal is the following
clipping from the "Philadelphia Press":&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">BOSTON WARMED UP</p>

<blockquote><p>The Major has just returned from Boston, where he was
present at the Memorial Day services held in Boston
Theatre.</p>

<p>It was the real thing. I never imagined possible such a
genuine sweeping emotion as when that audience began to
sing the "Battle Hymn." If Boston was cold, it was thawed
by the demonstration on Tuesday. Myron W. Whitney
started to sing. He bowed to a box, in which we first recognized
Mrs. Howe, sitting with the Misses Wheeler. You
should have heard the yell. We could see the splendid white
head trembling; then her voice joined in, as Whitney sang,
"In the beauty of the lilies," and by the time he had reached
the words,&mdash;</p>

<p>
"As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,"&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>the whole vast audience was on its feet, sobbing and singing
at the top of its thousands of lungs. If volunteers were
really needed for the Philippines, McKinley could have had
us all right there.</p></blockquote>


<p><br />The same evening she went "to Unitarian meeting
in Tremont Temple, where read my screed about
Governor Andrew, which has cost me some work and
more anxiety. Rev. S. A. Eliot, whom I saw for the
first time, was charmingly handsome and friendly. I
was introduced as 'Saint Julia' and the whole audience
rose when I came forward to read. Item: I had
dropped my bag with my manuscript in the carriage,
but Charles Fox telephoned to the stable and got it
for me."</p>

<p>The spring of this year saw an epidemic of negro-lynching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266b" id="Page_266b">[266]</a></span>
which roused deep indignation throughout
the country. On May 20 the Journal records
"a wonderful meeting at Chickering Hall, called by
the colored women of Boston, to protest against the
lynching of negroes in the South. Mrs. Butler M.
Wilson presided, an octoroon and a woman of education.
Her opening address was excellent in spirit and
in execution. A daughter of Mrs. Ruffin also wrote
an excellent address: Mrs. Cheney's was very earnest
and impressive. Alice Freeman Palmer spoke as I
have never before heard her. My rather brief speech
was much applauded, as were indeed all of the others.
Mrs. Richard Hallowell was on the platform and
introduced Mrs. Wilson."</p>

<p>This brief speech brought upon her a shower of
letters, mostly anonymous, from persons who saw
only the anti-negro side of this matter, so dreadful in
every aspect. These letters were often denunciatory,
sometimes furious in tone, especially one addressed to</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. Howe, Negro Sympathizer,<br />
Boston.</i>
</p>

<p>This grieved her, but she did not cease to lift up her
voice against the evil thing whenever occasion offered.</p>

<p>"<i>July 7.</i> <i>Oak Glen.</i> ... My son and his wife came
over from Bristol to pass the day. He looks as young
as my grandsons do. At fifty, his hair is blond, without
gray, and his forehead unwrinkled."</p>

<p>"<i>July 16.</i> ... While in church I had a new thought
of the energy and influence of Christ's teaching. 'Ask
and ye shall receive,' etc. These little series of commands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267b" id="Page_267b">[267]</a></span>
all incite the hearers to action: Ask, seek,
knock. I should love to write a sermon on this, but
fear my sermonizing days are over, alas!"</p>

<p>"<i>August 7.</i> Determined to do more literary work
daily than I have been doing lately. Began a screed
about dear Bro' Sam, feeling that he deserved a fuller
mention than I have already given him...."</p>

my papers, the failure of printers to get on with my
book, and my many bills. Have almost had an attack

they borrowed, with some difficulty, from Charlotte
Whipple, who begged it of me, years ago. I hesitate to
allow it, because it contains a verse which I discarded,
as not up to the rest of the poem. It will undoubtedly
be an additional attraction for the volume....</p></blockquote>

<p><br />"<i>October 21.</i> My last moments in this dear place.
The past season appears to me like a gift of perfect
jewels. I pray that the winter may have in store for
me some good work and much dear and profitable
companionship. I must remember that this may be
my last summer here, or anywhere on earth, but must
bear in mind that it is best to act with a view to prolonged
life, since without this outlook, it is very hard
for us to endeavor or to do our best. Peace be with
you, beautiful summer and autumn. Amen."</p>

<p>She was never ready to leave Oak Glen; the town
house always seemed at first like a prison.</p>

<p>"<i>October 23</i>. Boston. A drizzly, dark day. I struggled
out twice, saying to myself: 'It is for your life.'..."</p>

<p>"<i>October 24.</i> Have had two days of chaos and discouragement...."</p>

<p>"<i>October 27.</i> A delightful and encouraging conference
of A.A.W. held in my parlors. The prevailing
feeling was that we should not disband, but should
hold on to our association and lie by, hoping to find
new innings for work. Florida was spoken of as good
ground for us. I felt much cheered and quickened by
the renewal of old friendships...."</p>

<p>A Western lecture trip had been planned for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269b" id="Page_269b">[269]</a></span>
autumn, but certain untoward symptoms developed
and Dr. Wesselhoeft said, "No! no! not even if you
had not had vertigo." She gave it up most reluctantly,
confiding only to the Journal the hope that she might
be able to go later.</p>

<p>"<i>November 9.</i> Celebration of dear Chev's birthday
at the Institution. I spoke of the New Testament
word about the mustard seed, so small but producing
such a stately tree. I compared this little seed to a
benevolent impulse in the mind of S. G. H. and the
Institution to a tree. 'What is smaller than a human
heart? What seems weaker than a good intention?
Yet the good intention, followed by the faithful heart,
has produced this great refuge in which many generations
have already found the way to a life of educated
usefulness.'..."</p>

<p>"<i>November 19....</i> Before the sermon I had prayed
for some good thought of God. This came to me in the
shape of a sudden perception to this effect: 'I am in
the Father's house already.'..."</p>

<p>"<i>November 30....</i> In giving thanks to-day, I made
my only personal petitions, which were first, that
some of my dear granddaughters might find suitable
husbands, ... and lastly, that I might <i>serve</i> in some
way until the last breath leaves my body...."</p>

<p>"<i>December 16.</i> I had greatly desired to see the
'Barber.' Kind Mrs. [Alfred] Batcheller made it possible
by inviting me to go with her. The performance
was almost if not quite <i>bouffe</i>. Sembrich's singing
marvellous, the acting of the other characters excellent,
and singing very good, especially that of De Reszke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270b" id="Page_270b">[270]</a></span>
and Campanari. I heard the opera in New York more
than seventy years ago, when Malibran, then Signorina
Garcia, took the part of Rosina."</p>

<p>"<i>December 31....</i> 'Advertiser' man came with a
query: 'What event in 1899 will have the greatest
influence in the world's history?' I replied, 'The
Czar's Peace Manifesto, leading to the Conference at
The Hague.'"</p>


<p><br />November, 1899, saw the birth of another institution
from which she was to derive much pleasure, the
Boston Authors' Club. Miss Helen M. Winslow first
evolved the idea of such a club. After talking with
Mmes. May Alden Ward and Mabel Loomis Todd,
who urged her to carry out the project, she went to
see the "Queen of Clubs." "Go ahead!" said our
mother. "Call some people together here, at my
house, and we will form a club, and it will be a good
one too."</p>

<p>The Journal of November 23 says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Received word from Helen Winslow of a meeting
of literary folks called for to-morrow morning at my
house."</p>

<p>This meeting was "very pleasant: Mrs. Ward, Miss
Winslow, Jacob Strauss, and Hezekiah Butterworth
attended&mdash;later Herbert Ward came in."</p>

<p>It was voted to form the Boston Authors' Club, and
at a second meeting in December the club was duly
organized.</p>

<p>In January the Authors' Club made its first public
appearance in a meeting and dinner at Hotel Vendôme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271b" id="Page_271b">[271]</a></span>
Mrs. Howe presiding, Colonel Higginson (whom she
described as her "chief Vice") beside her.</p>

<p>The brilliant and successful course of the Authors'
Club need not be dwelt on here. Her connection with
it was to continue through life, and its monthly
meetings and annual dinners were among her pet pleasures.
She was always ready to "drop into rhyme"
in its service, the Muse in cap and bells being
oftenest invoked: <i>e.g.</i>, the verses written for the five
hundredth anniversary of Chaucer's death:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Poet Chaucer had a sister,<br />
He, the wondrous melodister.<br />
She didn't write no poems, oh, no!<br />
Brother Geoffrey trained her so.<br />
Honored by the poet's crown,<br />
Her posterity came down.<br />
<br />
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * <br />
<br />
Ages of ancestral birth<br />
Went for all that they were worth.<br />
Hence derives the Wentworth name<br />
Which heraldic ranks may claim.<br />
That same herald has contrived<br />
How the Higginson arrived.<br />
<br />
He was gran-ther to the knight<br />
In whose honor I indite<br />
Burning strophes of the soul<br />
'propriate to the flowing bowl.<br />
<br />
Oft the worth I have defended<br />
Of the Laureate-descended,<br />
But while here he sits and winks<br />
I can tell you what he thinks.<br />
<br />
"Never, whether old or young,<br />
Will that woman hold her tongue!<br />
Fifty years in Boston schooled,<br />
Still I find her rhyme-befooled.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272b" id="Page_272b">[272]</a></span>Oft in earnest, oft in jest,<br />
We have met and tried our best.<br />
Nought I dread an open field,<br />
I can conquer, I can yield,<br />
Self from foes I can defend,<br />
But Heav'n preserve us from our friend!"<br />
</p>

<p>She and her "chief Vice" were always making merry
together; when their flint and steel struck, the flash
was laughter. It may have been at the Authors' Club
that the two, with Edward Everett Hale and Dr.
Holmes, were receiving compliments and tributes one
afternoon.</p>

<p>"At least," she cried, "no one can say that Boston
drops its <i>H's</i>!"</p>

<p>This was in the winter of 1900. It was the time
of the Boer War, and all Christendom was sorrowing
over the conflict. On January 3 the Journal
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This morning before rising, I had a sudden thought
of the Christ-Babe standing between the two armies,
Boers and Britons, on Christmas Day. I have devoted
the morning to an effort to overtake the heavenly
vision with but a mediocre result."</p>

<p>These lines are published in "At Sunset."</p>

<p>On the 11th the cap and bells are assumed once
more.</p>

<p>"... To reception of the College Club, where I was
to preside over the literary exercises and to introduce
the readers. I was rather at a loss how to do this, but
suddenly I thought of Mother Goose's 'When the pie
was opened, the birds began to sing.' So when Edward
Everett Hale came forward with me and introduced me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273b" id="Page_273b">[273]</a></span>
as 'the youngest person in the hall,' I said, 'Ladies
and Gentlemen, I shall prove the truth of what our
reverend friend has just said, by citing a quotation
from Mother Goose ['When the pie was opened,' etc.],
and the first bird that I shall introduce will be Rev.
E. E. Hale.' Beginning thus, I introduced T. W. Higginson
as the great American Eagle; Judge [Robert]
Grant as a mocking-bird; C. F. Adams as the trained
German canary who sings all the songs of Yawcob
Strauss; C. G. Ames said, 'You mustn't call me an
owl.' I brought him forward and said, 'My dear
minister says that I must not call him an owl, and
I will not; only the owl is the bird of wisdom and he
is very wise.' I introduced Mrs. Moulton as a nightingale.
For Trowbridge I could think of nothing and
said, 'This bird will speak for himself.' Introduced
N. H. Dole as 'a bird rarely seen, the ph&oelig;nix.' At
the close E. E. H. said, 'You have an admirable
power of introducing.' This little device pleased me
foolishly."</p>

<p>"<i>February 4.</i> Wrote a careful letter to W. F. Savage.
He had written, asking an explanation of some old
manuscript copy of my 'Battle Hymn' and of the theft
perpetrated of three of its verses in 'Pen Pictures of
the War,' only lately brought to my notice. He evidently
thought these matters implied doubt at least
of my having composed the 'Hymn.' To this suspicion
I did not allude, but showed him how the
verses stolen had been altered, probably to avoid
detection...."</p>

<p>"<i>March 3.</i> Count di Campello's lecture, on the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274b" id="Page_274b">[274]</a></span>
life in Italy, was most interesting. His uncle's
movement in founding a National Italian Catholic
Church seemed to me to present the first solution I
have met with, of the absolute opposition between
Catholic and Protestant. A Catholicism without
spiritual tyranny, without ignorant superstition,
would bridge over the interval between the two opposites
and bring about the unification of the world-church...."</p>

<p>"<i>March 13....</i> Passed the whole morning at State
House, with remonstrants against petition forbidding
Sunday evening concerts. T. W. H. spoke remarkably
well...."</p>

<p>"<i>March 30....</i> Had a special good moment this
morning before rising. Felt that God had granted me
a good deal of heaven, while yet on earth. So the
veil lifts sometimes, not for long."</p>


<p><br />April found her in Minneapolis and St. Paul, lecturing
and being "delightfully entertained."</p>

<p>"<i>May 8. Minneapolis.</i> Spoke at the University,
which I found delightfully situated and richly endowed.
Was received with great distinction. Spoke,
I think, on the fact that it takes the whole of life to
learn the lessons of life. Dwelt a little on the fact
that fools are not necessarily underwitted. Nay, may
be people of genius, the trouble being that they do
not learn from experience...."</p>

<p>On leaving she exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Farewell, dear St. Paul. I shall never forget you,
nor this delightful visit, which has renewed (almost)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275b" id="Page_275b">[275]</a></span>
the dreams of youth. In the car a kind old grandmother,
with two fine little boy grands....</p>

<p>"The dear old grandmother and her boys got out
at the Soo. Other ladies in the Pullman were <i>very</i>
kind to me, especially a lady from St. Paul, with her
son, who I thought might be a young husband. She
laughed much at this when I mentioned it to her.
Had an argument with her, regarding hypnotism, I
insisting that it is demoralizing when used by a strong
will to subdue a weak one."</p>

<p>"<i>May 25.</i> [<i>Boston.</i>] Went in the afternoon to Unitarian
meeting at Tremont Temple. S. A. Eliot made
me come up on the platform. He asked if I would give
a word of benediction. I did so, thanking God earnestly
in my heart for granting me this sweet office,
which seemed to lift my soul above much which has
disturbed it of late. Why is He so good to me? Surely
not to destroy me at last."</p>

<p>"<i>June 3....</i> Before church had a thought of some
sweet spirit asking to go to hell to preach to the people
there. Thought that if he truly fulfilled his office, he
would not leave even that forlorn pastorate...."</p>

<p>"<i>June 10....</i> Could not find the key to my money
bag, which distressed me much. Promised St. Anthony
of Padua that if he would help me, I would take pains
to find out who he was. Found the key immediately...."</p>

<p>"<i>June 18....</i> The little lump in my right breast
hurts me a little to-day. Have written Wesselhoeft
about it. 4.50 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> He has seen it and says that it is
probably cancerous; forbids me to think of an operation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276b" id="Page_276b">[276]</a></span>
thinks he can stop it with medicine. When he
told me that it was in all probability a cancer, I felt at
first much unsettled in mind. I feared that the thought
of it would occupy my mind and injure my health by
inducing sleeplessness and nervous excitement. Indeed,
I had some sad and rather vacant hours, but
dinner and Julia's<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> company put my dark thought to
flight and I lay down to sleep as tranquilly as usual."</p>

<p>[Whatever this trouble was, it evidently brought
much suffering, but finally disappeared. We learn of
it for the first time in this record; she never spoke
of it to any of her family.]</p>

<p>"<i>Oak Glen. June 21.</i> Here I am seated once more
at my old table, beginning another <i>villeggiatura</i>, which
may easily be my last. Have read a little Greek and
a long article in the 'New World.' I pray the dear
Heavenly Father to help me pass a profitable season
here, improving it as if it were my last, whether it
turns out to be so or not."</p>

<p>[She was not in her usual spirits this summer. She
felt the heat and the burden of years. The Journal is
mostly in a minor key.]</p>

<p>"<i>July 16.</i> Took up a poem at which I have been
working for some days, on the victims in Pekin; a
strange theme, but one on which I feel I have a word
to say. Wrote it all over...."</p>

<p>"<i>July 19.</i> Was much worn out with the heat. In
afternoon my head gave out and would not serve me
for anything but to sit still and observe the flight of
birds and the freaks of yellow butterflies...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277b" id="Page_277b">[277]</a></span>"<i>July 26.</i> Have prayed to-day that I may not find
life dull. This prolongation of my days on earth is so
precious that I ought not to cease for one moment to
thank God for it. I enjoy my reading as much as
ever, but I do feel very much the narrowing of my
personal relations by death. How rich was I in sisters,
brothers, elders! It seems to me now as if I had not
at all appreciated these treasures of affection...."</p>

<p>"<i>July 31.</i> Have writ notes of condolence to Mrs.
Barthold Schlesinger and to M. E. Powel. I remember
the coming of Mrs. Powel's family to Newport sixty-five
years ago. The elders used to entertain in the
simple ways of those days, and my brother Henry
and I used to sing one duet from the 'Matrimonio
Segreto,' at some of their evening parties. In the afternoon
came the ladies of the Papéterie; had our tea in
the green parlor, which was pretty and pleasant...."</p>

<p>... I grieve for the death of King Umberto, as
any one must who has followed the fortunes of Italy
and knows the indebtedness of the country to the
House of Savoy. Thus, the horror of this anarchy,
thriving among Italians in our own country. I am so
thankful that the better class among them have come
out so strongly against it! I was present when King
Umberto took the oaths of office, after the death of his
father. He was a faithful man, not quite up to the
times, perhaps, but his reign was beset with problems
and difficulties. I am sure that the Queen greatly respected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278b" id="Page_278b">[278]</a></span>
and honored him, although I believe that she
was first betrothed to his brother Amadeo, whom, it
is said, she loved. Alas, for the tyranny of dynastic
necessity. Their only child was very delicate, and
has no child, or had not, when I was in Rome. As to
the Chinese horror, it is unspeakably dreadful. Even
if the ministers are safe, hundreds of foreigners and
thousands of native Christians have been cruelly
massacred. I cannot help hoping that punishment
will be swift and severe....</p>

<p>A letter from H. M. H. yesterday, in great spirits.
At a great public dinner recently, the president of the
association cried: "<i>Honneur à Howe!</i>"</p>

<p><br />"<i>August 17....</i> In the evening I was seized with
an attack of verse and at bedtime wrote a rough draft
of a <i>Te Deum</i> for the rescue of the ministers in Pekin."</p>

<p>"<i>August 20....</i> Got my poem smooth at some
expense of force, perhaps. I like the poem. I think
that it has been <i>given</i> me."</p>

<p>This <i>Te Deum</i> was printed in the "Christian
Herald" in September, 1900.</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday, September 2....</i> I had, before service
began, a clear thought that <i>self</i> is death, and deliverance
from its narrow limitations the truest emancipation.
In my heart I gave thanks to God for all measure
in which I have attained, or tried to attain, this liberation.
It seems to me that the one moment of this
which we could perfectly attain, would be an immortal
joy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279b" id="Page_279b">[279]</a></span>A week later, she went to New York to attend a
reception given to the Medal of Honor Legion at
Brooklyn Academy. She writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last evening's occasion was to me eminently worth
the trouble I had taken in coming on. To meet these
veterans, face to face, and to receive their hearty
greeting, was a precious boon vouchsafed to me so
late in life. Their reception to me was cordial in the
extreme. The audience and chorus gave me the Chautauqua
salute, and as I left the platform, the girl
chorus sang the last verse of my 'Hymn' over again,
in a subdued tone, as if for me alone. The point which
I made, and wished to make, was that, 'our flag should
only go forth on errands of justice, mercy, etc., and
that once sent forth, it should not be recalled until
the work whereunto it had been pledged was accomplished.'
This with a view to Pekin...."</p>

<p>"<i>September 13....</i> The Galveston horror<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> was much
in my mind yesterday. I could not help asking why
the dear Lord allowed such dreadful loss of life...."</p>

<p>"<i>October 25.</i> My last writing at this time in this
dear place. The season, a very busy one, has also been
a very blessed one. I cannot be thankful enough for
so much calm delight&mdash;my children and grandchildren,
my books and my work, although this last
has caused me many anxieties. I cannot but feel as
old John Forbes did when he left Naushon for the last
time and went about in his blindness, touching his
writing materials, etc., and saying to himself, 'Never
again, perhaps.' If it should turn out so in my case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280b" id="Page_280b">[280]</a></span>
God's will be done. He knows best when we should
depart and how long we should stay...."</p>

<p>"On the way home and afterwards, these lines of
an old hymn ran in my mind:&mdash;</p>

<p>
'Fear not, I am with thee, oh, be not afraid.<br />
I, I am thy God, and will still give thee aid.'<br />
</p>

<p>This comforted me much in the forlorn exchange of
my lovely surroundings at Oak Glen for the imprisonment
of a town house."</p>

<p>"<i>November 4. 241 Beacon Street.</i> The dear minister
preached on 'All Saints and All Souls,' the double
festival of last week. At Communion he said: 'Dear
Sister Howe, remember that if you are moved to speak,
you have freedom to do so.' I had not thought of
speaking, but presently rose and spoke of the two
consecrated days. I said: 'As I entered this church to-day,
I thought of a beautiful cathedral in which one
after another the saints whom I have known and
loved, appeared on either side; first, the saints of my
own happy childhood, then the excellent people whom
I have known all my life long. The picture of one of
them hangs on these walls.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> His memory is fresh in
all our hearts. Surely it is a divine glory which we
have seen in the faces of these friends, and they seem
to lead us up to that dearest and divinest one, whom
we call Master'; and so on. I record this to preserve
this vision of the cathedral of heart saints...."</p>

<p>"<i>December 25.</i> I was awake soon after five this
morning, and a voice, felt, not heard, seemed to give
me a friendly warning to set my house in order for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281b" id="Page_281b">[281]</a></span>
my last departure from it. This seems to bring in
view my age, already long past the scriptural limit,
suggesting also that I have some symptoms of an
ailment which does not trouble me much, but which
would naturally tend to shorten my life. In my mind
I promised that I would heed the warning given. I
only prayed God to make the parting easy for me
and my dear ones, of whom dear Maud would be the
most to be pitied, as she has been most with me and
has no child to draw her thoughts to the future. After
this, I fell asleep.</p>

<p>"We had a merry time at breakfast, examining the
Christmas gifts, which were numerous and gratifying...."</p>

<p>"<i>December 31....</i> Here ends a year of mercies, of
more than my usual health, of power to speak and to
write. It has been a year of work. God be thanked
for it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>STEPPING WESTWARD</h3>

<h4>1901-1902; <i>aet.</i> 82-83</h4>

<blockquote><p>But here the device of the spiral can save us. We must make the round,
but we may make it with an upward inclination. "Let there be light!" is
sometimes said in accents so emphatic, that the universe remembers and
cannot forget it. We carry our problems slowly forward. With all the ups
and downs of every age, humanity constantly rises. Individuals may preserve
all its early delusions, commit all its primitive crimes; but to the
body of civilized mankind, the return to barbarism is impossible.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">J. W. H.</span>
</p></blockquote>


<p><br />"<i>January 7.</i> I have had a morning of visioning,
lying in bed. 'Be still and know that I am God,'
seemed to be my sentence. I thought of the Magdalen's
box of spikenard, whose odor, when the box was
broken, filled the house. The separate religious convictions
of the sects seemed to me like so many boxes
of ointment, exceedingly precious while shut up, but I
thought also that the dear Lord would one day break
these separate boxes, and that then their fragrance
would fill the whole earth, which is His house.</p>

<p>"This is my first writing in this book. From this
thought and the 'Be still,' I may try to make two
sermons.</p>

<p>"In afternoon came William Wesselhoeft, Sr., and
prescribed entire quiet and rest for some days to come.
Oh! I do long to be at work."</p>

<p>"<i>January 9.</i> To-day for the first time since January
3, I have opened a Greek book. I read in my Æschylus
["Eumenides"] how Apollo orders the Furies to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283b" id="Page_283b">[283]</a></span>
his shrine, to go where deeds of barbarity, tortures, and
mutilations are practised."</p>

<p>At this time she heard of her son's receiving from
the Czar the cross of the Order of St. Stanislas. She
writes to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious me!</p>

<p>"Are you sure it isn't by mistake? Do you remember
that you are my naughty little imp?...
Well, well, it takes away my breath! Dearest Boy,
my heart is lifted up with gratitude. If your father
were only here, to share our great rejoicing! Joy!
joy!..."</p>

<p>She had always taken a deep interest in Queen
Victoria, whose age was within three days of her own.
Many people fancied a resemblance between the two;
indeed, when in England as a bride, she was told
more than once: "You look like our young Queen!"
It is remembered how one of her daughters, knocking
at the door of a Maine farmhouse to inquire the way,
was met by a smiling, "I know who you are! You are
the daughter of the Queen of America!"</p>

<p>The Queen's death, coming as it did during her own
illness, gave her a painful shock.</p>

<p>"<i>January 23.</i> The news of Queen Victoria's death
quite overcame me for a moment this morning. Instead
of settling to my work, I wrote a very tiny 'bust
of feeling' about her, which I carried to the 'Woman's
Journal' office, where I found a suffrage meeting in
progress. I could only show myself and say that I
was not well enough to remain...."</p>

<p>"Bust of feeling" was a favorite expression of hers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284b" id="Page_284b">[284]</a></span>
Old Bostonians will recall its origin. "A certain rich
man," seeing a poor girl injured in a street accident,
offered to pay her doctor's bill. This being presented
in due time, he disclaimed all responsibility in the
affair; and when reminded of his offer, exclaimed,
"Oh, that was a bust of feeling!"</p>

<p>On January 31, she was "in distress of mind all day
lest Maud should absolutely refuse to let me give my
lecture at Phillips Church this evening." Later she
writes: "Maud was very kind and did nothing to
hinder my going to South Boston." She went and
enjoyed the evening, but was not so well after it.</p>

<p>"<i>February 10.</i> A Sunday at home; unable to venture
out. Wesselhoeft, Jr., called, left medicine, and forbade
my going out before the cough has ceased. Have
read in Cheyne's 'Jewish Religious Life after the
Exile,' finding the places of reference in the Bible.
Afterwards read in 'L'Aiglon,' which is very interesting
but not praiseworthy, as it endeavors to recall the
false glory of Napoleon."</p>

<p>"<i>February 18.</i> Have been out, first time since February
3, when I went to church and was physically the
worse for it.... Last night had a time of lying awake
with a sort of calm comfort. Woke in the morning
full of invalid melancholy, intending to keep my bed.
Felt much better when in motion. Must make a vigorous
effort now to get entirely well."</p>


<p><br />These days of seclusion were hard for her, and every
effort was made to bring the "mountains" to her,
since she could not go to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285b" id="Page_285b">[285]</a></span>A club was formed among her friends in Boston for
the study and speaking of Italian: this became one of
her great pleasures, and she looked forward eagerly to
the meetings, delighted to hear and to use the beautiful
speech she had loved since childhood.</p>

<p>"<i>February 22.</i> The new club, <i>Il Circolo Italiano</i>, met
at our house. Count Campello had asked me to say
a few words, so I prepared a very little screed in Italian,
not daring to trust myself to speak <i>extempore</i> in
this language. We had a large attendance; I thought
one hundred were present. My bit was well received,
and the lecture by Professor Speranza, of New York,
was very interesting, though rather difficult to follow.
The theme was D'Annunzio's dramas, from which he
gave some quotations and many characterizations.
He relegates D'Annunzio to the Renaissance when
<i>Virtù</i> had no real <i>moral significance</i>. Compared him
with Ibsen. The occasion was exceedingly pleasant."</p>


<p class="center"><i>To Laura</i></p>

<blockquote><p>I had hoped to go to church to-day, but my Maud
and your Julia decided against it, and so I am having
the day at home. It is just noon by my dial, and Maud
is stretched in my Gardiner chair, comfortably shawled,
and reading Lombroso's book on "The Man of Genius,"
with steadfast attention. Lombroso's theory seems to
be that genius, almost equally with insanity, is a result
of degeneration....</p></blockquote>


<p><br />"<i>March 1.</i> The first day of spring, though in this
climate this is a <i>wintry</i> month. I am thankful to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286b" id="Page_286b">[286]</a></span>
got on so far in this, my eighty-second year. My
greatest trouble is that I use so poorly the precious
time spared to me. Latterly I have been saying to myself,
'Can you not see that the drama is played out?'
This partly because my children wish me to give up
public speaking."</p>

<p>"<i>March 4....</i> To New England Woman's Club;
first time this year, to my great regret and loss. I was
cordially welcomed.... A thought suddenly came to
me, namely, that the liberal education of women
would give the death-blow to superstition. I said, 'We
women have been the depositaries of religious sensibility,
but we have also furnished the impregnable
storehouse of superstition, sometimes gracious, sometimes
desperately cruel and hurtful to our race.' No
one noticed this, but I hold fast to it...."</p>

<p>"<i>March 8....</i> To Symphony Concert in afternoon,
which I enjoyed but little, the music being of the
multi-muddle order so much in vogue just now. An
air of Haydn's sounded like a sentence of revelation
in a chatter...."</p>

<p>It may have been after this concert that she wrote
these lines, found in one of her notebooks:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Such ugly noises never in my life<br />
My ears endured, such hideous fiddle-strife.<br />
A dozen street bands playing different tunes,<br />
A choir of chimney sweeps with various runes,<br />
The horn that doth to farmer's dinner call,<br />
The Chinese gong that serves in wealthier hall,<br />
The hammer, scrub brush, and beseeching broom,<br />
While here and there the guns of freedom boom,<br />
"Tzing! bang! this soul is saved!" "Clang! clang! it isn't!"<br />
And <i>mich</i> and <i>dich</i> and <i>ich</i> and <i>sich</i> and <i>sisn't</i>!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287b" id="Page_287b">[287]</a></span>Five dollar bills the nauseous treat secured,<br />
But what can pay the public that endured?<br />
</p>

<p>"<i>March 17.</i> Before lying down for a needed rest, I
must record the wonderful reception given to-day to
Jack Elliott's ceiling.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The day was fine, clear sunlight.
Many friends congratulated me, and some
strangers. Vinton, the artist, Annie Blake, Ellen
Dixey were enthusiastic in their commendation of
the work, as were many others. I saw my old friend,
Lizzie Agassiz, my cousin Mary Robeson and her
daughter, and others too numerous to mention....
This I consider a day of great honor for my family....
<i>Deo gratias</i> for this as well as for my son's
decoration."</p>

<p>"<i>March 31....</i> Had a sort of vision in church of
Moses and Christ, the mighty breath of the prophets
reaching over many and dark ages to our own time, with
power growing instead of diminishing. When I say
a vision, I mean a vivid thought and mind picture."</p>

<p>"<i>April 3.</i> Have writ to Larz Anderson, telling him
where to find the quotation from Horace which I gave
him for a motto to his automobile, 'Ocior Euro.'
Sanborn found it for me and sent it by postal. It
must have been more than thirty years since dear
Brother Sam showed it to me...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 7.</i> A really inspired sermon from C. G. A.,
'The power of an unending life.' ... The Communion
which followed was to me almost miraculous. Mr.
Ames called it a festival of commemoration, and it
brought me a mind vision of the many departed dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288b" id="Page_288b">[288]</a></span>
ones. One after another the dear forms seemed to
paint themselves on my inner vision: first, the nearer
in point of time, last my brother Henry and Samuel
Eliot. I felt that this experience ought to pledge me
to new and more active efforts to help others. In my
mind I said, the obstacle to this is my natural inertia,
my indolence; then the thought, God can overcome
this indolence and give me increased power of service
and zeal for it. Those present, I think, all considered
the sermon and Communion as of special power and
interest. It almost made me fear lest it should prove
a swan song from the dear minister. Perhaps it is I,
not he, who may soon depart."</p>

<p>Later in April she was able to fulfil some lecture
engagements in New York State with much enjoyment,
but also much fatigue. After her return she
felt for a little while "as if it was about time for her
to go," but her mind soon recovered its tone.</p>

<p>Being gently reproved for giving a lecture and
holding a reception on the same day, she said, "That
is perfectly proper: I gave and I received: I was
scriptural and I was blessed."</p>

<p>Asked on another occasion if it did not tire her to
lecture,&mdash;"Why, no! it is they [the audience] who
are tired, not I!"</p>

<p>On April 27 she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have had a great gratification to-day. Mrs. Fiske
Warren had invited us to afternoon tea and to hear
Coquelin deliver some monologues. I bethought me
of my poem entitled 'After Hearing Coquelin.' Maud
wrote to ask Mrs. Warren whether she would like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289b" id="Page_289b">[289]</a></span>
have me read it and she assented. I procured a fresh
copy of the volume in which it is published, and took
it with me to this party, which was large and <i>very</i> representative
of Boston's most recognized people. Miss
Shedlock first made a charming recitation in French,
which she speaks perfectly. Then Coquelin gave three
delightful monologues. The company then broke up
for tea and I thought my chance was lost, but after a
while order was restored. M. Coquelin was placed
where I could see him, and I read the poem as well as
I could. He seemed much touched with the homage,
and I gave him the book. People in general were
pleased with the poem and I was very glad and thankful
for so pleasant an experience. Learned with joy
of the birth of a son to my dear niece, Elizabeth
Chapman."</p>

<p>Another happy birthday came and passed. After
recording its friendly festivities, she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am <i>very</i> grateful for all this loving kindness.
Solemn thoughts must come to me of the long past
and of the dim, uncertain future. I trust God for His
grace. My life has been poor in merit, in comparison
to what it should have been, but I am thankful that
to some it has brought comfort and encouragement,
and that I have been permitted to champion some
good causes and to see a goodly number of my descendants,
all well endowed physically and mentally,
and starting in life with good principles and intentions;
my children all esteemed and honored for honorable
service in their day and generation."</p>

<p>"<i>May 30. Decoration Day....</i> In the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290b" id="Page_290b">[290]</a></span>
Maud and I drove out to Mount Auburn to visit the
dear graves. We took with us the best of the birthday
flowers, beautiful roses and lilies. I could not have
much sense of the presence of our dear ones. Indeed,
they are not there, but where they are, God only
knows."</p>

<p>"<i>May 31.</i> Free Religious meeting.... The fears
which the bold programme had naturally aroused in
me, fears lest the dear Christ should be spoken of in
a manner to wound those who love him&mdash;these fears
were at once dissipated by the reverent tone of the
several speakers...."</p>

<p>"<i>June 1....</i> To the Free Religious festival.... I
found something to say about the beautiful morning
meeting and specially of the truth which comes down
to us, mixed with so much rubbish of tradition. I spoke
of the power of truth 'which burns all this accumulation
of superstition and shines out firm and clear, so
we may say that "the myth crumbles but the majesty
remains."'..."</p>

<p>She managed to do a good deal of writing this
summer: wrote a number of "screeds," some to order,
some from inward leading: <i>e.g.</i>, a paper on "Girlhood
Seventy Years Ago," a poem on the death of President
McKinley.</p>

<p>"<i>October 5.</i> A package came to-day from McClure's
Syndicate. I thought it was my manuscript returned
and rejected, and said, 'God give me strength not to
cry.' I opened it and found a typewritten copy of my
paper on 'Girlhood,' sent to me for correction in lieu
of printer's proof. Wrote a little on my screed about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291b" id="Page_291b">[291]</a></span>
'Anarchy.' Had a sudden thought that the sense
and spirit of government is responsibility."</p>

<p>"<i>October 6....</i> Wrote a poem on 'The Dead Century,'
which has in it some good lines, I hope."</p>

<p>"<i>October 8.</i> The cook ill with rheumatism. I made
my bed, turning the mattress, and put my room generally
to rights. When I lay down to take my usual
<i>obligato</i> rest, a fit of verse came upon me, and I had to
abbreviate my lie-down to write out my <i>inspiration</i>."</p>

<p>The "<i>obligato</i> rest"! How she did detest it! She
recognized the necessity of relaxing the tired nerves
and muscles; she yielded, but never willingly. The
noon hour would find her bending over her desk, writing
"for dear life," or plunged fathoms deep in Grote's
"Greece," or some other light and playful work.
Daughter or granddaughter would appear, watch in
hand, countenance steeled against persuasion. "Time
for your rest, dearest!"</p>

<p>The rapt face looks up, breaks into sunshine, melts
into entreaty. "Let me finish this note, this page;
then I will go!" Or it may be the sprite that looks out
of the gray eyes. "Get out!" she says. "Leave the
room! I never saw you before!"</p>

<p>Finally she submits to the indignity of being tucked
in for her nap; but even then her watch is beside her
on the bed, ticking away the minutes till the half-hour
is over, and she springs to her task.</p>

<p>"<i>November 3. 241 Beacon Street.</i> My room here has
been nicely cleaned, but I bring into it a great heap of
books and papers. I am going to try <i>hard</i> to be less
disorderly than in the past."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292b" id="Page_292b">[292]</a></span>How hard she did try, we well remember. The book
trunk was a necessity of the summer flitting. It carried
a full load from one book-ridden house to the
other, and there were certain books&mdash;the four-volume
Oxford Bible, the big-print Horace, the Greek classics,
shabby of dress, splendid of type and margin&mdash;which
could surely have found their way to and
from Newport unaided.</p>

<p>One book she never asked for&mdash;the English dictionary!
Once Maud, recently returned from Europe,
apologized for having inadvertently taken the dictionary
from 241 Beacon Street.</p>

<p>"How dreadful it was of me to take your dictionary!
What have you done? Did you buy a new one?"</p>

<p>"I did not know you had taken it!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;how did you get along without a dictionary?"</p>

<p>The elder looked her surprise.</p>

<p>"I never use a word whose meaning I do not know!"</p>

<p>"But the spelling?"</p>

<p>There was no answer to this, save a whimsical shrug
of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"<i>November 11.</i> The day of the celebration of dear
Chev's one hundredth birthday. Before starting for
the Temple I received three beautiful gifts of flowers,
a great bunch of white roses from Lizzie Agassiz, a
lovely bouquet of violets from Mrs. Frank Batcheller,
and some superb chrysanthemums from Mrs. George
H. Perkins. The occasion was to me one of solemn joy
and thankfulness. Senator Hoar presided with beautiful
grace, preluding with some lovely reminiscences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293b" id="Page_293b">[293]</a></span>
Dr. Howe's visit to his office in Worcester, Massachusetts,
when he, Hoar, was a young lawyer. Sanborn
and Manatt excelled themselves, Humphreys did very
well. Hoar requested me to stand up and say a few
words, which I did, he introducing me in a very felicitous
manner. I was glad to say my word, for my heart
was deeply touched. With me on the platform were
my dear children and Jack Hall and Julia Richards;
Anagnos, of course; the music very good."</p>

<p>Senator Hoar's words come back to us to-day, and
we see his radiant smile as he led her forward.</p>

<p>"It is only the older ones among us," he said, "who
have seen Dr. Howe, but there are hundreds here who
will want to tell their children that they have seen
the author of the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic.'"</p>

<p>Part of her "word" was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have listened to-day to very heroic memories;
it almost took away our breath to think that such
things were done in the last century. I feel very grateful
to the pupils and graduates of the Perkins Institution
for the Blind who have planned this service in
honor of my husband. It is a story that should be
told from age to age to show what one good resolute
believer in humanity was able to accomplish for the
benefit of his race.... The path by which he led
Laura Bridgman to the light has become one of the
highways of education, and a number of children similarly
afflicted are following it, to their endless enlargement
and comfort. What an encouragement does this
story give to the undertaking of good deeds!</p>

<p>"I thank those who are with us to-day for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294b" id="Page_294b">[294]</a></span>
sympathy and attention. I do this, not in the name
of a handful of dust, dear and reverend as it is, that
now rests in Mount Auburn, but in the name of a
great heart which is with us to-day and which will
still abide with those who work in its spirit."</p>

<p>"<i>November 26. Thursday.</i> A day of pleasant agitation
from beginning to end. I tried to recognize in
thought the many mercies of the year. My fortunate
recoveries from illness, the great pleasures of study,
friendly intercourse, thought and life generally. Our
Thanksgiving dinner was at about 1.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and was
embellished by the traditional turkey, a fine one, to
which David, Flossy, Maud, and I did justice. The
Richards girls, Julia and Betty, and Chug<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and Jack
Hall, flitted in and out, full of preparation for the
evening event, the marriage of my dear Harry Hall to
Alice Haskell. I found time to go over my screed for
Maynard very carefully, rewriting a little of it and
mailing it in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"In the late afternoon came Harry Hall and his best
man, Tom McCready, to dine here and dress for the
ceremony. Maud improvised a pleasant supper: we
were eight at table. Went to the church in two carriages.
Bride looked very pretty, simple white satin
dress and tulle veil. Six bridesmaids in pink, carrying
white chrysanthemums. H. M. H.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> seemed very boyish,
but looked charmingly...."</p>

<p>"<i>December 31.</i> The last day of a blessed year in
which I have experienced some physical suffering, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295b" id="Page_295b">[295]</a></span>
also many comforts and satisfactions. I have had
grippe and bronchitis in the winter and bad malarial
jaundice in the summer, but I have been constantly
employed in writing on themes of great interest and
have had much of the society of children and grandchildren.
Of these last, two are happily married, <i>i.e.</i>,
in great affection. My dear Maud and her husband
have been with me constantly, and I have had little
or no sense of loneliness...."</p>


<p><br />The beginning of 1902 found her in better health
than the previous year.</p>

<p>She records a luncheon with a distinguished company,
at which all agreed that "the 'Atlantic' to-day
would not accept Milton's 'L' Allegro,' nor would any
other magazine."</p>

<p>At the Symphony Concert "the Tschaikowsky
Symphony seemed to me to have in it more noise than
music. Felt that I am too old to enjoy new music."</p>

<p>"<i>January 24.</i> Suffrage and Anti-Suffrage at the
State House. I went there with all of my old interest
in the Cause. The Antis were there in force: Mrs.
Charles Guild as their leader; Lawyer Russell as their
manager. I had to open. I felt so warm in my faith
that for once I thought I might convert our opponents.
I said much less than I had intended, as is usually the
case with me when I speak <i>extempore</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>February 7....</i> I went to see Leoni's wonderful
illuminated representation of leading events in our
history; a very remarkable work, and one which ought
to remain in this country."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296b" id="Page_296b">[296]</a></span>"<i>February 11.</i> Dreamed of an interview with a
female pope. I had to go to Alliance Meeting to
speak about Wordsworth. I hunted up some verses
written about him in my early enthusiasm, probably
in 1840 or 1841. This I read and then told of my visit
to him with Dr. Howe and the unpleasantness of the
experience. Spoke also of the reaction in England
against the morbid discontent which is so prominent
and powerful in much of Byron's poetry...."</p>

<p>"<i>February 12....</i> In my dream of yesterday morning
the woman pope and I were on very friendly terms.
I asked on leaving whether I might kiss her hand.
She said, 'You may kiss my hand.' I found it fat and
far from beautiful. As I left her, methought that her
countenance relaxed and she looked like a tired old
woman. In my dream I thought, 'How like this is to
what Pope Leo would do.'"</p>

<p>"<i>February 13....</i> Felt greatly discouraged at first
waking. It seemed impossible for me to make a first
move under so many responsibilities. A sudden light
came into my soul at the thought that God will help
me in any good undertaking, and with this there came
an inkling of first steps to be taken with regard to
Sig. Leoni's parchment.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> I went to work again on my
prize poem, with better success than hitherto...."</p>

<p>"<i>February 14.</i> Philosophy at Mrs. Bullard's.... Sent
off my prize poem with scarcely any hope of its obtaining
or indeed deserving the prize, but Mar<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> has promised
to pay me something for it in any case, and I was bound
to try for the object, namely, a good civic poem...."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297b" id="Page_297b">[297]</a></span>"<i>February 15....</i> A day of great pleasure, profit
and fatigue.... Griggs's lecture.... The address on
'Erasmus and Luther' was very inspiring. Griggs is
in the full tide of youthful inspiration and gives himself
to his audience without stint. He did not quite
do justice to the wonderful emancipation of thought
which Protestantism has brought to the world, but
his illustration of the two characters was masterly. I
said afterwards to Fanny Ames: 'He will burn himself
out.' She thinks that he is wisely conservative of
his physical strength. I said, 'He bleeds at every
pore.' I used to say this of myself with regard to
ordinary social life. Went to the Club, where was
made to preside. Todd and Todkinee<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> both spoke
excellently. Then to Symphony Concert to hear Kreisler
and the 'Pastoral Symphony.'"</p>

<p>"<i>February 16....</i> The Philosophy meeting and
Griggs's lecture revived in me the remembrance of my
philosophic studies and attempts of thirty-five years
ago, and I determined to endeavor to revise them and
to publish them in some shape. Have thought a good
deal this morning of this cream of genius in which the
fervent heat of youth fuses conviction and imagination
and gives the world its great masters and masterpieces.
It cannot outlast the length of human life of
which it is the poetry. Age follows it with slow philosophy,
but can only strengthen the outposts which
youth has gained with daring flight. Both are divinely
ordained and most blessed. Of the dear Christ the
world had only this transcendent efflorescence. I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298b" id="Page_298b">[298]</a></span>
to Ames yesterday, 'I find in the Hebrew prophets
all the doctrine which I find in Christ's teaching.' He
said, 'Yes, it is there seminally.' We agreed that it
was the life which made the difference."</p>

<p>"<i>February 21</i>.... My dearest Maud left by 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
train to sail for Europe to-morrow. I could not go to
the hearing. Was on hand to think of small details
which might have been overlooked. Gave them my
fountain pen, to Jack's great pleasure. Julia Richards
came to take care of me. I suffered extreme depression
in coming back to the empty house, every corner of
which is so identified with Maud's sweet and powerful
presence. The pain of losing her, even for a short
time, seemed intolerable. I was better in the evening.
Chug amused me with a game of picquet."</p>

<p>Her spirits soon rallied, and the granddaughters
did their best to fill the great void. She writes to
Laura about this time:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>

<p><br />"<i>March 25.</i> I received in one day three notes asking
me regarding the 'Life of Margaret Shepard,' and
'Secret Confessions of a Priest.' One writer had seen
in some paper that she could have the books by applying
to me; Miss &mdash;&mdash; wrote to the same intent;
Miss &mdash;&mdash; wrote and enclosed forty cents' worth of
stamps for one of the books. I have replied to all that
I know nothing of the books in question, and that I
am neither agent nor bookseller."</p>

<p>"<i>March 30.</i> Lunch with Mrs. Fields after church.
Heard a very inspiring sermon from Samuel A. Eliot.
This young man has a very noble bearing and a stringent
way of presenting truth. He has that vital religious
power which is rare and most precious. Before
he had spoken I had been asking in my mind, how can
we make the <i>past present to us</i>? The Easter service
and Lent also seem intended to do this, but our imaginations
droop and lag behind our desires...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 2.</i>... Went in the evening to see 'Ben-Hur'
with kind Sarah Jewett&mdash;her treat, as was my attendance
at the opera. The play was altogether spectacular,
but very good in that line...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 3.</i>... Went to the celebration of E. E.
Hale's eightieth birthday, in which the community
largely participated. Senator Hoar was the orator and
spoke finely.... Hale's response was manly, cheery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300b" id="Page_300b">[300]</a></span>
and devout. He has certainly done much good work,
and has suggested many good things."</p>

<p>"<i>April 12.</i> Lunch with Mrs. Wheelwright. I found
Agnes Repplier very agreeable. She had known the
wife of Green, the historian, 'very, almost too brilliant.'
Told me something about his life. I enjoyed
meeting her."</p>

<p><br />"<i>May 16.</i> In the evening the Italian supper at the
Hotel Piscopo, North End. I recited Goldoni's toast
from the 'Locandiera,' and also made a little speech
at the end of the banquet. Padre Roberto, a Venetian
priest, young and handsome, sat near me...."</p>

<p>"<i>May 18</i>.... I had prayed that this might be a
real Whitsunday to me and I felt that it was. Notice
was given of a meeting at which Catholic, Jew, Episcopalian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301b" id="Page_301b">[301]</a></span>
and Unitarian are to speak regarding the
Filipinos. This seemed like the Millennium. It is the
enlargement of religious sympathy; not, as some may
think, the progress of critical indifferentism.</p>

<p>"During this morning's service my desire to speak
to prisoners reasserted itself strongly; also my thought
of one of my sermons which I wish to write. One
should be to the text: 'The glory of God in the face
of Jesus Christ,' the reflection of divine glory in God's
saints, like the reflection of the sun's light in the
planets. Another about Adam being placed in Eden
to tend the flowers and water them. This should concern
our office in the land of our birth, into which we
are born to love and serve our country. Will speak of
the self-banished Americans, Hale's 'Man without a
Country,' etc. This day has been so full of thought
and suggestion that I hardly know how to let it go.
I pray that it may bear some fruit in my life, what is
left of it."</p>

<p>"<i>May 24.</i> The annual Club luncheon in honor of
my birthday. I felt almost overwhelmed by the great
attention shown me and by the constant talk of
speakers with reference to myself.... I don't find in
myself this charm, this goodness, attributed to me by
such speakers, but I know that I love the Club and
love the world of my own time, so far as I know it.
They called me Queen and kissed my hand. When I
came home I fell in spirit before the feet of the dear
God, thanking Him for the regard shown me, and praying
that it might not for one moment make me vain. I
read my translation of Horace's ode, 'Quis Desiderio,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302b" id="Page_302b">[302]</a></span>
and it really seemed to suit the mention made by Mrs.
Cheney of our departed members, <i>praecipuë</i>, Dr. Zack;
Dr. Hoder [?] of England was there, and ex-Governor
Long and T. W. Higginson, also Agnes Irwin. It was
a great time."</p>

<p>"<i>July 5</i>.... I wrote to Ethel V. Partridge, Omaha,
a high-school student: 'Get all the education that you
can. Cultivate habits of studious thought with all
that books can teach. The fulfilment of the nearest
duty gives the best education.' I fear that I have
come to know this by doing the exact opposite, <i>i.e.</i>,
neglecting much of the nearest duty in the pursuit of
an intellectual wisdom which I have not attained...."</p>


<p><br />Maud and Florence were both away in the early
part of this summer, and various grandchildren kept
her company at Oak Glen. There were other visitors,
among them Count Salome di Campello, a cheery
guest who cooked spaghetti for her, and helped the
granddaughter to set off the Fourth of July fireworks,
to her equal pleasure and terror. During his
visit she invited the Italian Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> to spend a
couple of days at Oak Glen. On July 14 she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not having heard from the Italian Ambassador,
the Count and I supposed that he was not coming. In
the late afternoon came a letter saying that he would
arrive to-morrow. We were troubled at this late intelligence,
which gave me no time to invite people to
meet the guest. I lay down for my afternoon rest with
a very uneasy mind. Remembering St. Paul's words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303b" id="Page_303b">[303]</a></span>
about 'Angels unawares,' I felt comforted, thinking
that the Angel of Hospitality would certainly visit
me, whether the guest proved congenial or not."</p>

<p>"<i>July 15</i>.... The Ambassador arrived as previously
announced. He proved a most genial and
charming person; a man still in the prime of life, with
exquisite manners, as much at home in our simplicity
as he doubtless is in scenes of luxury and magnificence.
Daisy Chanler drove out for afternoon tea, at my
request, and made herself charming. After her came
Emily Ladenberg, who also made a pleasing impression.
Our guest played on the piano and joined in
our evening whist. We were all delighted with
him."</p>

<p>After the Ambassador's departure she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He gave me an interesting account of King Charles
Albert of Savoia. He is a man of powerful temperament,
which we all felt; has had to do with Bismarck
and Salisbury and all the great European politicians
of his time. We were all sorry to see him depart."</p>


<p><br />The Journal tells of many pleasures, among them
"a delightful morning in the green parlor with Margaret
Deland and dear Maud."</p>

<p>On August 24 she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This day has been devoted to a family function of
great interest, namely, the christening of Daisy and
Wintie's boy baby, Theodore Ward, the President<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
himself standing godfather. Jack Elliott and I were
on hand in good time, both of us in our best attire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304b" id="Page_304b">[304]</a></span>
We found a very chosen company, the Sydney Websters,
Owen Wister, Senator Lodge and wife, the
latter standing as godmother. Mr. Diman, of the
School,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> officiated, Parson Stone being ill. The President
made his response quite audibly. The Chanler
children looked lovely, and the baby as dear as a
baby can look. His godfather gave him a beautiful
silver bowl lined with gold. I gave a silver porringer,
Maud a rattle with silver bells; lunch followed. President
Roosevelt took me in to the table and seated me
on his right. This was a very distinguished honor.
The conversation was rather literary. The President
admires Emerson's poems, and also Longfellow and
Sienkiewicz. He paid me the compliment of saying
that Kipling alone had understood the meaning of my
'Battle Hymn,' and that he admired him therefor.
Wister proposed the baby's health, and I recited a
quatrain which came to me early this morning. Here
it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Roses are the gift of God,<br />
Laurels are the gift of fame;<br />
Add the beauty of thy life<br />
To the glory of thy name."<br />
</p>

<p>"I said, 'Two lines for the President and two for
the baby'; the two first naturally for the President.
As I sat waiting for the ceremony, I called the dear
roll of memory, Uncle Sam and so on back to Grandpa
Ward. I was very thankful to participate in this
beautiful occasion. But the service and talk about
the baby's being born in sin, etc., etc., seemed to me
very inconsistent with Christ's saying that he who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305b" id="Page_305b">[305]</a></span>
would enter into the Kingdom of Heaven must become
'as a little child.' He also said, 'of such is the kingdom
of heaven.'"</p>

<p>She had a high admiration for Colonel Roosevelt,
and a regard so warm that she would never allow any
adverse criticism of him in her presence. The following
verses express this feeling:&mdash;</p>

<p>

<p>On September 12, a notice of the death of William
Allen Butler is pasted in the Diary. Below it she
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A pleasant man. I met him at the Hazeltines' in
Rome in 1898 and 1899. His poem ["Nothing to
Wear"] was claimed by one or two people. I met his
father [a Cabinet Minister] at a dinner at the Bancrofts'
in New York, at which ex-President Van Buren
was also present, and W. M. Thackeray, who said to
me across the table that Browning's 'How They
Brought the Good News' was a 'good jingle.'"</p>

<p>On the 29th she spoke at a meeting of the New
England Woman's Club in memory of Dr. Zakrzewska,
and records her final words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pray God earnestly that we women may never
go back from the ground which has been gained for
us by our noble pioneers and leaders. I pray that
these bright stars of merit, set in our human firmament,
may shine upon us and lead us to better and
better love and service for God and man."</p>

<p>"In the afternoon, to hear reports of delegates to
Biennial at Los Angeles. These were very interesting,
but the activity shown made me feel my age, and its
one great infirmity, loss of power of locomotion. I felt
somehow the truth of the line which Mr. Robert C.
Winthrop once quoted to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'Superfluous lags the veteran on the stage.'"<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307b" id="Page_307b">[307]</a></span>Yet a few days later she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had this morning so strong a feeling of the goodness
of the divine Parent in the experience of my life,
especially of its most trying period, that I had to cry
out, 'What shall I, who have received so much, give
in return?' I felt that I must only show that forbearance
and forgiveness to others which the ever blessed
One has shown to me. My own family does not call
for this. I am cherished by its members with great
tenderness and regard. I thought later in the day
of a sermon to prisoners which would brighten their
thoughts of the love of God. Text from St. John's
Epistle, 'Behold what manner of love is this that we
should be called the sons of God.'"</p>


<p><br />This was the year of the coal strike in Pennsylvania,
which made much trouble in Boston. She notes one
Sunday that service at the Church of the Disciples
was held in the church parlors "on account of the
shortage of coal." This recalls vivid pictures of the
time; distracted coal merchants dealing out promises,
with nothing else to deal; portly magnates and
stately dames driving down Beacon Street in triumph
with coals in a paper bag to replenish the parlor fire:
darker pictures, too, of poverty and suffering.</p>

<p>At 241 Beacon Street the supply was running low,
and the coal dealer was summoned by telephone. "A
load of coal? Impossible, madam! We have no&mdash;I

<p><br />The year 1903 began with the celebration at Faneuil
Hall of the fortieth anniversary of Lincoln's Emancipation
Proclamation. She was one of the speakers.
"I felt much the spirit of the occasion, and spoke,
I thought, better than usual, going back to the heroic
times before and during the war, and to the first celebration
forty years ago, at which I was present."</p>

<p>Work of all kinds poured in, the usual steady stream.</p>

<p>"<i>January 6.</i> Wrote a new circular for Countess."</p>

<p>Who the Countess was, or what the circular was
about, is not known. By this time it had become the
custom (or so it seemed to exasperated daughters and
granddaughters) for any one who wanted anything in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309b" id="Page_309b">[309]</a></span>
the literary line, from a proverb to a pamphlet, to ask
her for it.</p>

<p>It is remembered how on a certain evening, when
she was resting after a weary day, a "special delivery"
note was received from a person whom she scarcely
knew, asking for "her thoughts on the personality of
God, by return mail." This was one of the few requests
she ever denied. People asked her to give them
material for their club papers (sometimes to write
them!), to put them through college, to read their
manuscripts, to pay the funeral expenses of their relatives.
A volume of the letters conveying these requests
would be curious reading.</p>

<p>The petition for a "little verse" was rarely refused.
Her notebooks are full of occasional poems, only a
small proportion of which ever appeared in print.

Let me write a friendly note, and you shall sign it!"</p>

<p>"You're right," she said, "I can't: I am too tired
to think!" But when she saw the note taken away,
"No, no!" she cried, "I can! He is probably a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310b" id="Page_310b">[310]</a></span>

<p>The verses in the notebooks are by no means all "by
request." The rhyming fit might seize her anywhere,
at any time. She wrote the rough draft on whatever
was at hand, often on the back of note, circular, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311b" id="Page_311b">[311]</a></span>
newspaper wrapper. She could never forget the war-time
days when paper cost half a dollar a pound.</p>

<p>Nor were people content with writing: they came
singly, in pairs, in groups, to proffer requests, to pay
respects, to ask counsel. The only people she met unwillingly
were those who came to bewail their lot and
demand her sympathy.</p>

<p>No one will ever know the number of her benefactions.
They were mostly, of necessity, small, yet we
must think they went a long way. At the New England
Woman's Club, whenever a good new cause came up,
she would say, "I will start the subscription with a
dollar!" Many noble and enduring things began with
the "President's dollar." If she had had a hundred
dollars to give, it would have been joyfully given: if
she had had but ten cents, it would not have been withheld.
She had none of the false pride which shrinks
from giving a small sum.</p>

<p>Beggars and tramps were tenderly dealt with.
A discharged criminal in particular must never be
refused help. Work must be found for him if possible;
if not, it is to be feared that he got a dollar, "to help
him find work"!</p>

<p>"<i>January 10.</i> At 11.30 received message from 'New
York World' that it would pay for an article sent at
once on 'Gambling among Society People.' Wrote
this in a little more than an hour."</p>

<p>"<i>January 20....</i> Some little agitation about my
appearance at the Artists' Festival to-night, as one of
the patronesses. I had already a white woollen dress
quite suitable for the prescribed costume. Some benevolent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312b" id="Page_312b">[312]</a></span>
person or persons ordered for me and sent a
cloak of fine white cloth, beautiful to look at but heavy
to wear. A headdress was improvised out of one of my
Breton caps, with a long veil of lawn. Jack Elliott
made me a lovely coronet out of a bit of gold braid
with one jewel of dear Maud's. Arriving, to my surprise,
I found the Queen's chair waiting for me. I sat
thereon very still, the other patronesses being most
kind and cordial, and saw the motley throng and the
curious pageants. Costumes most beautiful, but the
hall too small for much individual effect. Adèle Thayer
wore the famous Thayer diamonds."</p>

<p>"<i>January 27.</i> Woke early and began to worry about
the hearing.... Dressed with more care than usual
and went betimes to State House. Had a good deliverance
of my paper. The opposition harped upon our
bill as an effort to obtain class legislation, saying also
that they knew it to be an entering wedge to obtain
suffrage for all women; the two positions being evidently
irreconcilable. When our turn for rebuttal came,
I said: 'Many years ago John Quincy Adams presented
in Congress a petition for the abolition of slavery in
the District of Columbia, but none of the Southerners
imagined that this petition was intended to keep the
other negroes of the South in slavery! Are we, who,
for thirty years past, and more, have been coming
here to ask for full suffrage for all women, to be accused
of coming here now with a view to the exclusion of
our former clients from suffrage? How can we be said
to contemplate this and at the same time to be putting
in an entering wedge for universal suffrage?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313b" id="Page_313b">[313]</a></span>"I thank God for what I did say at the hearing and
for what I did not say. Two of the opposing speakers
were rude in their remarks; all were absurd, hunting
an issue which they knew to be false, namely, our
seeking for class legislation."</p>

<p>"<i>January 28.</i> Although very tired after yesterday's
meeting, I went in the evening to see 'Julius Cæsar' in
Richard Mansfield's interpretation. The play was
beautifully staged; Mansfield very good in the tent

<p>"<i>March 3.</i> My dear Maud returned this evening
from New York. She has been asked to speak at to-morrow's
suffrage hearing. I advised her to reflect
before embarking upon this new voyage.... When
she told me what she had in mind to say, I felt that a
real word had been given her. I said: 'Go and say
that!'..."</p>

<p>"<i>April 11.</i> To Mrs. Bigelow Lawrence's, Parker
House, to hear music. Mrs. [Henry] Whitman called
for me.</p>

<p>"Delightful music; two quartettes of Beethoven's,
a quintette of Mozart's, which I heard at Joseph Coolidge's
some thirty or more years ago. I recognized it
by the first movement, which Bellini borrowed in a
sextette which I studied in my youth from 'La Straniera,'
an opera never given in these days...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 17.</i> Winchendon lecture.... A day of anguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314b" id="Page_314b">[314]</a></span>
for me. I was about to start for Winchendon
when my dearest Maud so earnestly besought me not
to go, the weather being very threatening, that I <i>could
not</i> deny her. Words can hardly say how I suffered in
giving up the trip and disappointing so many people....
As I lay taking my afternoon rest, my heart said
to God, 'You cannot help me in this'; but He did help
me, for I was able soon after this to interest myself in
things at hand. I heard Mabilleau's lecture on French
art in its recent departure. It was brilliant and forcibly
stated, but disappointing. He quoted with admiration
Baudelaire's hideous poem, 'Un Carogne.'..."</p>

<p>"<i>April 21.</i> In the afternoon attended anniversary
of the Blind Kindergarten, where I made, as usual, a
brief address, beginning with 'God said, Let there be
light,' a sentence which makes itself felt throughout
the human domain, where great-hearted men are
stirred by it to combat the spirits of darkness. Spoke
also of the culture of the blind as vindicating the dignity
of the human mind, which can become a value and
a power despite the loss of outward sense. Alluded to
dear Chev's sense of this and his resolve that the blind,
from being simply a burden, should become of value
to the community. The care of them draws forth
tender sympathy in those whose office it is to cherish
and instruct them. Spoke of the nursery as one of the
dearest of human institutions. Commended the little
blind nursery to the affectionate regard of seeing
people. The children did exceedingly well, especially
the orchestra. The little blind 'cellist was remarkable."</p>

<p>"<i>May 2.</i> Dreamed last night that I was dead and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315b" id="Page_315b">[315]</a></span>
kept saying, 'I found it out immediately,' to those
around me...."</p>

<p>"<i>May 28.</i> My prayer for the new year of my life
beginning to-day is, that in some work that I shall
undertake I may help to make clear the goodness of

do...."</p>

<p>"<i>June 22.</i> Mabel Loomis Todd wrote asking me for
a word to enclose in the corner-stone of the new
observatory building at Amherst [Massachusetts]. I
have just sent her the following:&mdash;</p>

"The stars against the tyrant fought<br />
In famous days of old;<br />
The stars in freedom's banner wrought<br />

<p>"<i>June 23.</i> Kept within doors by the damp weather.
Read in William James's book, 'Varieties of Religious
Experience.'... Had a strange fatigue&mdash;a restlessness
in my brain."</p>

<p>"<i>June 25....</i> The James book which I finished
yesterday left in my mind a painful impression of
doubt; a God who should be only my better self, or an
impersonal pervading influence. These were suggestions
which left me very lonely and forlorn. To-day,
as I thought it all over, the God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob seemed to come back to me; the God of
Christ, and  his saints and martyrs. I said to myself:
'Let me be steeped in the devotion of the Psalms, and
of Paul's Epistles!' I took up Coquerel's sermons
on the Lord's Prayer, simple, beautiful, positive...."</p>

<p>"<i>July 30.</i> <i>Oak Glen.</i> Rose at 6.15 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and had good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316b" id="Page_316b">[316]</a></span>
luck in dressing quickly. With dear Flossy took 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
train for Boston. At Middletown station found the
teachers from the West [Denver and Iowa], who
started the 'Battle Hymn' when they saw me approaching.
This seemed to me charming. My man
Michael, recognizing the tune, said: 'Mrs. Howe, this
is a send-off for you!'..."</p>

<p>She was going to keep a lecture engagement in Concord,
Massachusetts; her theme, "A Century from the
Birth of Emerson." She was anxious about this paper,
and told Mr. Sanborn (the inevitable reporter calling
to borrow her manuscript) that she thought the less
said about the address the better. "I have tried very
hard to say the right thing, but doubt whether I
have succeeded." Spite of these doubts, the lecture
was received with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"<i>September 6.</i> I was very dull at waking and dreaded
the drive to church and the stay to Communion. The
drive partly dissipated my 'megrims'; every bright
object seemed to me to praise God.... The Communion
service was very comforting. Especially did
Christ's words come to me, 'Abide in me,' etc. I felt
that if I would abide in Him, old as I am, I could still
do some good work. 'Yes! my strong friend,' my heart
said, 'I will abide in thee,' and a bit of the old Easter
anthem came back to me, 'He sitteth at the right
hand of God, in the glory of the Father.' No, it is a
verse of the <i>Te Deum</i>."</p>

<p>In October a lecture in South Berwick gave her the
opportunity, always greatly enjoyed, of a visit to
Sarah Orne Jewett and her sister Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317b" id="Page_317b">[317]</a></span>"<i>November 1.</i> <i>South Berwick.</i> A delightful drive.
Mary Jewett, Annie Fields, and I to visit Mrs. Tyson
in the Hamilton House described by Sarah in her
'Tory Lover.'... Most interesting. Mrs. Tyson very
cordial and delightful.... She came over later to dinner
and we had such a pleasant time! In afternoon
copied most of my screed for the 'Boston Globe.'"</p>

<p>It surely was not on this occasion that she described
dinner as "a thing of courses and remorses!"</p>

<p>"<i>November 2.</i> Took reluctant leave of the Jewett
house and the trio, Sarah, Mary, and Annie Fields.
We had a wonderful dish of pigeons for lunch...."</p>

<p>It was delightful to see our mother and Miss Jewett
together. They were the best of playmates, having a
lovely intimacy of understanding. Their talk rippled
with light and laughter. Such stories as they told!
such songs as they sang! who that heard will ever
forget our mother's story of Edward Everett in his
youth? He was to take three young ladies to drive,
and had but the one horse; he wished to please them
all equally. To the first he said, "The horse is perfectly
fresh now; you have him in his best condition."
To the second he said, "The horse was a little antic
at first, so you will have the safer drive." To the
third he said, "Now that the other two have had
their turn, we need not hasten back. You can have
the longest drive."</p>

<p>It is recalled that during this visit, when Laura
felt bound to remonstrate in the matter of fruitcake,
"Sarah" took sides with ardor. "You shall have all
you want, Mrs. Howe, and a good big piece to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318b" id="Page_318b">[318]</a></span>
home besides! Put it somewhere where the girls can't
find it!"</p>

<p>She nodded. "There is a corner in my closet, which
even Maud dare not explore!"</p>

<p>The fruitcake was duly packed, transported, and
eaten&mdash;we are bound to say without ill effect.</p>

<p>This recalls the day when, leaving Gardiner, she
was presented with a packet of sandwiches, and
charged to have the Pullman porter bring her a cup of
bouillon. The next day Laura received a postal card.</p>

<p>"Lunched at Portland on mince pie, which agreed
with me excellently, thank you!"</p>

<p>Her postal cards were better than most people's
letters. You could almost see them sparkle. The signature
would be "Town Pump" or something equally
luminous. In fact, she so rarely signed her own name
in writing to us that when asked for autographs we
were posed. "Town Pump" was no autograph for the
author of the "Battle Hymn"!</p>

<p>There was another mince pie, a little, pretty one,
which she saw at a Papéterie meeting, the last summer
of her life; saw, coveted, secreted, with her hostess's aid,
and smuggled home. Always a moderate eater, she
never could be made to see that age demanded a careful
diet. "I have eaten sausages all my life," she would
say. "They have always agreed with me perfectly!" Indeed,
till the very latest years, her digestion had never
failed her. It was in the eighties that she said to one
of us, "I have a singular sensation that I have never
felt before. Do you think it might possibly be indigestion?"
She described it, and it <i>was</i> indigestion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319b" id="Page_319b">[319]</a></span>
We are reminded of a contemporary of hers who, being
gently rebuked for giving rich food to a delicate
grandchild, replied with lofty scorn, "Stuff and nonsense!
<i>Teach his stomach!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>November 8....</i> In late afternoon some visioning,
<i>i.e.</i>, lying down to rest and asking and answering questions
in my mind:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Question: Can anything exceed the delight of the
first mutual understanding of two lovers?</p>

<p>"Answer: This has its sacredness and its place, but
even better is the large affection which embraces things
human and divine, God and man.</p>

<p>"Question: Are Saviour and Saints alive now?</p>

<p>"Answer: If you believe that God is just, they must
be. They gave all for His truth: He owes them immortality."</p>

<p>"<i>November 16.</i> Dear Auntie Francis's wedding day.
I think it was in 1828. My sisters and I were bridesmaids,
my brothers groomsmen. Dear father, very
lame, walked up with a cane to give her away. Grandma
Cutler looked much discontented with the match.
Father sent the pair off in his own carriage, with four
horses, their manes and tails braided with white ribbons.
They drove part of the way to Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"<i>November 28....</i> To Wellesley College.... William
Butler Yeats lectured on the revival of letters in
Ireland. We dined with him afterwards at Miss Hazard's
house. He is a man of fiery temperament, with
a slight, boyish figure: has deep-set blue eyes and dark
hair; reminds me of John O'Sullivan<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> in his temperament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320b" id="Page_320b">[320]</a></span>
is certainly, as Grandpa Ward said of the Red
Revolutionists, with whom he dined in the days of the
French Revolution, 'very warm.'"</p>

<p>"<i>November 29....</i> This came into my mind,
apropos of reformers generally: 'Dost thou so carry thy
light as to throw it upon <i>thyself</i>, or upon thy <i>theme</i>?'
This appears to me a legitimate question...."</p>

<p>"<i>December 21.</i> Put the last touches to my verses
for Colonel Higginson's eightieth birthday. Maud went
with me to the celebration held by the Boston Authors'
Club at the Colonial Club, Cambridge. T. W. H.
seemed in excellent condition; I presided as usual.
Bliss Perry, first speaker, came rather late, but made
a very good address. Crothers and Dean Hodges followed,
also Clement. Judge Grant read a simple, strong
poem, <i>very good</i>, I thought. Then came my jingle, intended
to relieve the strain of the occasion, which I
think it did. Maud says that I hit the bull's eye; perhaps
I did. Then came a pretty invasion of mummers,
bearing the gifts of the Club, a fine gold watch and
a handsome bronze lamp. I presented these without
much talk, having said my say in the verses, to which,
by the bye, Colonel H. responded with some comic
personal couplets, addressed to myself."</p>

<p>She never forgot the hackmen in severe weather.</p>

<p>"They <i>must</i> have something hot!" and tea or coffee

oppose, but went with me and remained until our part
of the hearing was finished, when she carried me off. I
read my little screed, written yesterday. When I said,
'Intelligence has no sex, no, gentlemen, nor folly
either!' laughter resounded, as I meant it should...."</p>

'Oh, rest in the Lord.' The audience seemed to me
sleepy and cold. I really led the applause for the alto."</p>

a carriage for me and I took Mary, the maid.... Mr.
Dan was waiting outside for me, as was another of the

me by one arm, very superfluous. My entrance was
greeted with applause, and I was led to the high seats,
where were two aides of the Governor, Dewey and
White, the latter of whom remembers Governor Andrew.

occasion at length, noting that she was "favored with
the Tufts yell twice."</p>

<p>"Lawrence Evans came, and Harry Hall.... I read
the part of my speech about which I had hesitated,
about our trying to put an end to the Turkish horrors.
It was the best of the speech. Seeking divine aid before
I made my remarks, I suddenly said to myself,
'Christ, <i>my brother</i>!' I never <i>felt</i> it before."</p>

<p>"<i>June 16.</i> Maud would not allow me to attend
Quincy Mansion School Commencement, to my sincere
regret. The fatigue of yesterday was excessive,
and my dear child knew that another such occasion
would be likely to make me ill. Charles G. Ames came,
from whom I first learned the death of Mrs. Cheney's
sister, Mary Frank Littlehale; the funeral set for to-day....
Dear E. D. C. seemed gratified at seeing me
and asked me to say a few words.... She thanked
me very earnestly for what I had said, and I at last
understood why I had not been allowed to go to
Quincy. It was more important that I should comfort
for a moment the bruised heart of my dear friend
than that I should be a guest at the Quincy Commencement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325b" id="Page_325b">[325]</a></span>"<i>June 29.</i> Heard to my sorrow of the death of delightful
Sarah Whitman. Wrote a little screed for
'Woman's Journal' which I sent...."</p>

<p>In early July, she went to Concord for a memorial
meeting in honor of Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"<i>July 11....</i> Alice Blackwell, some days ago, wrote
beseeching me to write to President Roosevelt, begging
him to do something for the Armenians. I said
to myself, 'No, I won't; I am too tired and have done
enough.' Yesterday's sermon gave me a spur, and this
morning I have writ the President a long letter, to the
effect desired. God grant that it may have some result!"</p>

<p>"<i>July 17.</i> I despaired of being able to write a poem
as requested for the Kansas semi-centennial celebration
in October, but one line came to me: 'Sing us a
song of the grand old time!' and the rest followed...."</p>

<p>This poem is printed in "At Sunset."</p>

<p>"<i>July 21.</i> Writ ... to Mrs. Martha J. Hosmer, of
Rock Point, Oregon, who wrote me a kindly meant
letter, exhorting me to 'seek the truth and live,' and
to write to a Mrs. Helen Wilman, eighty-five years old
and the possessor of some wonderful knowledge which
will help me to renew my youth...."</p>

<p>"<i>September 25.</i> I could not go to church to-day,
fearing to increase my cold, and not wishing to leave
my dear family, so rarely united now. Have been reading
Abbé Loisy's 'Autour d'un petit Livre,' which is
an apologetic vindication of his work 'L'Évangile et
l'Église,' which has been put upon the Index [Expurgatorius].
I feel sensibly all differences between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326b" id="Page_326b">[326]</a></span>
his apologetic <i>wobbly</i> vindication of the Church of
Rome, and the sound and firm faith of Thomas Hill."</p>

<p>"<i>October 2.</i> Mr. Fitzhugh Whitehouse, having left
here a copy of my 'From Sunset Ridge' for me to furnish
with a 'sentiment,' I indited the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>
From Sunset Ridge we view the evening sky,<br />
Blood red and gold, defeat and victory;<br />
If in the contest we have failed or won,<br />
'Twas ours to live, to strive and so pass on."<br />
</p>

<p>"<i>October 5....</i> To Peace Congress, where Albert
Smiley was presiding. A wonderful feature came in the
person of a Hindu religionist, who came to plead the
cause of the Thibetan Llama. He said that the Thibetans
are not fighting people: are devoted to religious
contemplation, prayer, and spiritual life. He
spoke valorously of the religions in the East as by far
the most ancient. 'You call us heathen, but we don't
call you heathen'; a good point. He concluded by
giving to the assemblage a benediction in the fashion of
his own religion. It was chanted in a sweet, slightly
musical strain, ending with the repetition of a word
which he said meant 'peace.' So much was said about
peace that I had to ask leave for a word, and spoke of
justice as that without which peace cannot be had....
I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Mr. President and dear friends, assembled in the
blessed cause of Peace, let me remind you that there
is one word even more holy than peace, namely, justice.
It is anterior in our intellectual perceptions. The
impulse which causes men to contend against <i>in</i>justice
is a divine one, deeply implanted in the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327b" id="Page_327b">[327]</a></span>
breast. It would be wrong to attempt to thwart it.
I hope that The Hague Tribunal will bear in mind that
it is sacredly pledged to maintain justice. The brightest
intellects, the most profound study, should be devoted
to the promotion of this end.' The Greek bishop
met me in the ante-room and said, 'We always pray
for you.'..."</p>

<p>"<i>October 9.</i> I have felt more strongly than ever of
late that God is the only comforter.... These great
serious things were always present to work for in days
in which I exerted myself to amuse others and myself
too. It is quite true that I have never given up serious
thought and study, but I have not made the serious
use of my powers which I ought to have made. The
Peace Congress has left upon my mind a strong impression
of what the lovers of humanity could accomplish
if they were all and always in earnest. I seem to
hope for a fresh consecration, for opportunities truly
to serve, and for the continuance of that gift of the
word which is sometimes granted me."</p>

<p>"<i>November 12.</i> I to attend meeting of Council of
Jewish Women; say something regarding education....</p>

<p>"I was warmly received and welcomed, and recited
my 'Battle Hymn' by special request. This last gave
me an unexpected thrill of satisfaction. The president
said: 'Dear Mrs. Howe, there is nothing in it to wound
us.' I had feared that the last verse might trouble
them, but it did not."</p>

<p>"<i>November 19.</i> Was busy trying to arrange bills and
papers so as to go to Gardiner to-morrow with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328b" id="Page_328b">[328]</a></span>
Richards son-in-law, when in the late afternoon Rosalind
told me that dear noble Ednah Cheney had died.
This caused me much distress. My first word was:
'The house of God is closed! Such a friend is indeed a
sanctuary to which one might retire for refuge from
all mean and unworthy things.'</p>

<p>"A luminous intellect, unusual powers of judgment
and of sympathy as well. She has been a tower of
strength to me. I sent word by telephone to Charles
G. Ames, begging that <i>her</i> hymn might be sung at
church to-morrow...."</p>

<p>"<i>November 21.</i> Dear E. D. C.'s funeral.... I spoke
of her faith in immortality, which I remember as unwavering.
I said: 'No, that lustrous soul is not gone
down into darkness. It has ascended to a higher light,
to which our best affections and inspirations may
aspire.'"</p>

<p>"<i>December 25....</i> Got out my dearest little Sammy's
picture and placed it on my mantelshelf. [He
was a Christmas child.] Maud and I went to the
Oratorio, which we enjoyed.... I wondered whether
the heavenly ones could not enjoy the beautiful music."</p>

<p>"<i>December 31.</i> A little festivity.... At supper I
was called upon for a toast, and after a moment's
thought, responded thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"God grant us all to thrive,<br />
And for a twelvemonth to be alive,<br />
And every bachelor to wive;<br />
And many blessings on the head<br />
Of our dear Presidential Ted.<br />
</p>

<p>"We saw the year out; a year of grace to me, if ever
I had one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329b" id="Page_329b">[329]</a></span>The new year (1905) found her in full health and
activity. On its first day she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I begin this book by thanking God most deeply
that He has permitted me to see the dawn of this New
Year, and by praying that I may not wilfully waste
one of its precious days. I am now about half through
my eighty-sixth year and must feel no surprise if the
mandate to remove should come suddenly or at any
time. But while I live, dear Lord, let me truly live in
energetic thought and rational action. Bless, I pray
Thee, my own dear family, my blessed country,
Christendom, and all mankind. This is my daily
prayer and I record it here. Is it amiss that in this
prayer my own people come first? No! for family
affection is the foundation of all normal human relations.
We begin with the Heavenly Father and open
out to the whole human brotherhood."</p>

<p>"<i>January 2.</i> Had an anxious time hunting after my
Hawthorne screed to read this afternoon before the
New England Woman's Club. In my perplexity I
said: 'Lord, I do not deserve to have You help me
find it'; but the answer seemed to come thus: 'My
help is of grace and not according to desert'; and I
found it at once where I ought to have looked for it
at first...."</p>

<p>"<i>January 20....</i> You can't do good with a bad
action." [Apropos of the shot fired at the Czar.]</p>

<p>"The reason why a little knowledge is dangerous is
that your conceit of it may make you refuse to learn
more."</p>

<p>She was writing a paper on Mrs. Stowe and "Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330b" id="Page_330b">[330]</a></span>
Tom's Cabin," and worked hard over it. The pace
began to tell.</p>

<p>She spoke for the friends of Russian freedom, "a
warm speech, almost without preparation. I knew that
I should find my inspiration in the occasion itself. I
had almost a spasm of thankfulness to Almighty God
for the opportunity to speak for such a cause at such
a time."</p>

<p>At the suffrage hearing soon after, she "spoke of the
force of inertia as divinely ordained and necessary, but
ordained, too, to be overcome by the onward impulse
which creates worlds, life, and civilization. Said it was
this inertia which opposed suffrage, the <i>dread</i> of change
inherent in masses, material or moral, etc., etc."</p>

<p>Among her winter delights were the "Longy" concerts
of instrumental music. She writes of one:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was carried away by the delight of the music&mdash;all
wind instruments. A trio of Handel for bassoon
and two oboes was most solid and beautiful.... I
could think of nothing but Shakespeare's 'Tempest'
and 'Midsummer Night's Dream.' The thought that
God had set all human life and work to music overpowered
me, and coming home I had a rhapsody of
thanksgiving for the wonderful gift...."</p>

<p>The next day came an entertainment in aid of Atlanta
University and Calhoun School; she "enjoyed
this exceedingly, especially the plantation songs, which
are of profoundest pathos, mixed with overpowering
humor. It was pleasant, too, to see the audience in
which descendants of the old anti-slavery folk formed
quite a feature. I had worked hard at the screed which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331b" id="Page_331b">[331]</a></span>
was, I think, good. Heard interesting reports of mission
work in our entire South."</p>

<p>At the Authors' Club she met Israel Zangwill, who
was "rather indifferent" when introduced to her. She
thought he probably knew nothing about her, and
adds,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is good perhaps to be taken down, now and then."</p>

<p>In March she attended a hearing in connection with
the School Board. "The chair most courteously invited
me to speak, saying, 'There is here a venerable
lady who will hardly be likely to come here again for
the present discussion, so I shall give her the remaining
time.' Whereupon I leaped into the arena and said
my say."</p>

<p>She had been for some time toiling over a paper on
the "Noble Women of the Civil War," finding it hard
and fatiguing work. On April 5 she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At 12 <span class="smcap">M.</span> I had finished my screed on the 'Noble
Women of the Civil War' which has been my nightmare
ever since March 24, when I began it, almost despairing
of getting it done.... I have written very
carefully and have had some things to say which may,
I hope, do good. I can now take up many small tasks
which have had to give way to this one...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 9.</i> The Greek celebration. The Greek Papa,
in full costume, intoned the Doxology and the assembly
all sang solemn anthems. Michael introduced me
first. My speech was short, but had been carefully prepared.
At the request of the Papa I said at the end:
'<i>Zeto ton Ellenikon ethnos.</i>' My speech and Greek
sentence were much applauded. A young Greek lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332b" id="Page_332b">[332]</a></span>
presented me with a fine bouquet of white carnations
with blue and white ribbons, the colors of Greece.
Sanborn read from dear Chev's letters of 1825. Michael
spoke at great length, with great vehemence and
gesticulation. I understood many words, but could
only guess at the general drift. I imagine that it was
very eloquent, as he was much applauded."</p>

<p>"<i>April 30.</i> Lorin Deland called to talk about the
verses which I am to write and read at his theatre.
The thought of Cassandra seized me. She, coming to
the house of the Atridæ, had a vision of its horrors; I,
coming to this good theatre, have a vision of the good
things which have been enjoyed there and which shall
still be enjoyed. Wrote down some five or six lines,
'lest I forget.'"</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Deland were among her best friends
of the second generation. Indeed, there was such
a sympathy and comprehension between her and
"Margaret" that the latter playfully declared herself
a daughter abandoned in infancy, and was wont to sign
herself, "Your doorstep Brat"!</p>

<p>"<i>May 5....</i> 'Without religion you will never know
the real beauty and glory of life; you will perceive the
discords, but miss the harmony; will see the defects,
but miss the good in all things.'"</p>


<p><br />In these years an added burden was laid upon her,
in the general and affectionate desire for her presence
on all manner of occasions. The firemen must have
her at their ball, the Shoe and Leather Trade at their
banquet, the Paint and Oils Association at their dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333b" id="Page_333b">[333]</a></span>
Their festivities would not be complete without
her; she loved them, went to their parties, had the
right word to say, and came home happy, her arms full
of flowers.</p>

<p>It was all beautiful and heart-warming, but it had
to be paid for. May 10 brought the punishment for
this season.</p>

<p>"Annual Woman Suffrage supper. I was to have
spoken at this occasion and to have recited the poem
which I wrote for Castle Square Theatre, but it was
otherwise ordained. I rose as usual, my head a little
misty. A mighty blow of vertigo seized me.... The
elder Wesselhoeft pronounced it a 'brain fag,' not
likely to have serious results, but emphatically a <i>warning</i>
not to abuse further my nervous strength. Got up
in afternoon and finished 'Villa Claudia'; was bitterly
sad at disappointing the suffragists and Deland."</p>

<p>Dr. Wesselhoeft was asked on this occasion why, at
her age, so severe an attack as this had not resulted
in paralysis. "Because," he replied, "she brought to
receive it the strength of forty years of age!"</p>

<p>Sure enough, the next day she felt as if her "nervous
balance was very well restored," and in a week she
was at work again.</p>

<p>"<i>May 18....</i> In the evening had word of a Decoration
Day poem needed. At once tried some lines."</p>

<p>"<i>May 19.</i> Doubted much of my poem, but wrote
it, spending most of the working hours over it; wrote
and rewrote, corrected again and again. Julia Richards
mailed it at about 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>... Just as I went to bed
I remembered that in the third verse of my poem I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334b" id="Page_334b">[334]</a></span>
used the words 'tasks' and 'erect' as if they rhymed.
This troubled me a good deal. My prayer was, 'God
help the fool.'"</p>

<p>"<i>May 20.</i> My trouble of mind about the deficient
verse woke me at 6.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> I tossed about and wondered
how I could lie still until 7.30, my usual time for
rising. The time passed somehow. I could not think of
any correction to make in my verse. Hoped that I
should find that I had not written it as I feared. When
I came to look at it, there it was. Instantly a line with
a proper rhyme presented itself to my mind. To add
to my trouble I had lost the address to which I had
sent the poem. My granddaughter, Julia Richards,
undertook to interview the Syndicate by long-distance
telephone, and, failing this, to telegraph the new
line for me. So I left all in her hands. When I returned,
she met me with a smile and said, 'It is all
right, Grandmother.' She had gone out, found a New
York directory, guessed at the Syndicate, got the correspondent,
and put her in possession of the new line.
I was greatly relieved. I have been living lately with
work running after me all the time. Must now have
a breathing spell. Have still my 'Simplicity' screed
to complete."</p>


<p><br />The Authors' Club celebrated her eighty-sixth birthday
by a charming festival, modelled on the Welsh
Eistedfodd, "at which every bard of that nation
brought four lines of verse&mdash;a sort of four-leaved
clover&mdash;to his chief."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Sixty quatrains made what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335b" id="Page_335b">[335]</a></span>
she calls "an astonishing testimonial of regard." Colonel
Higginson, who presided most charmingly, read
many of these tributes aloud, and the Birthday Queen
responded in a rhyme scribbled hastily the day before.
Here are a few of the tributes, together with her
"reply":&mdash;</p>

<p><br />"<i>May 27.</i> My eighty-sixth birthday. I slept rather
late, yesterday having been eminently a 'boot-and-saddle'
day.... The Greeks, mostly working-people,
sent me a superb leash of roses with a satin ribbon
bearing a Greek inscription. My visitors were numerous,
many of them the best friends that time has left
me. T. W. H. was very dear. My dear ones of the
household bestirred themselves to send flowers, according
to my wishes, to the Children's Hospital and
to Charles Street Jail."</p>

<p>"<i>May 28.</i>... A great box of my birthday flowers
ornamented the pulpit of the church. They were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337b" id="Page_337b">[337]</a></span>
distributed afterwards to the Sunday-School children,
some to the Primary Teachers' Association; a bunch
of lilies of the valley to Reverend Hayward's funeral
to-morrow. I suddenly bethought me of Padre
Roberto, and with dear Laura's help sent him a box
of flowers for his afternoon service, with a few lines of
explanation, to which I added the motto: '<i>Unus deus,
una fides, unum baptisma.</i>' This filled full the cup of
my satisfaction regarding the disposal of the flowers.
They seemed to me such sacred gifts that I could not
bear merely to enjoy them and see them fade. Now
they will not fade for me."</p>


<p><br />Among the many "screeds" written this season was
one on "The Value of Simplicity," which gave her
much trouble. She takes it to pieces and rewrites it,
and afterwards is "much depressed; no color in anything."
From Gardiner she "writes to Sanborn" for
the Horatian lines she wishes to quote. ("Whenever,"
she said once to Colonel Higginson, "I want to find
out about anything difficult, I always write to Sanborn!"
"Of course!" replied Higginson. "We all do!"
At this writing the same course is pursued, there is
reason to believe, by many persons in many countries.)</p>

<p>It is remembered that in these days when she was
leaving Gardiner at the last moment she handed Laura
a note. It read, "Be sure to rub the knee thoroughly
night and morning!"</p>

<p>"Why," she was asked, "did I not have this a week
ago?"</p>

<p>"I hate to be rubbed!" she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338b" id="Page_338b">[338]</a></span>"<i>July 1. Oak Glen</i>.... Found a typed copy of my
'Rest' sermon, delivered in our own church, twelve
years ago. Surely preaching has been my greatest
privilege and in it I have done some of my best work."</p>

<p>"<i>July 2</i>. Unusually depressed at waking. Feared
that I might be visited by 'senile melancholia' against
which I shall pray with all my might.... Began
Plato's 'Laws.'"</p>

<p>Plato seems to have acted as a tonic, for on the same
day she writes to her daughter-in-law, expressing her
joy in "Harry's" latest honor, the degree of Doctor
of Laws conferred by Harvard College:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>To Mrs. Henry Marion Howe</i></p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Oak Glen</span>, July 2, 1905.
</div>

<p>Thanks very much for your good letter, giving me
such a gratifying account of the doings at Harvard
on Commencement Day. I feel quite moved at the
thought of my dear son's receiving this well-merited
honor from his <i>alma mater</i>. It shows, among other
things, how amply he has retrieved his days of boyish
mischief. This is just what his dear father did. I
think you must both have had a delightful time. How
did our H. M. H. look sitting up in such grave company?
I hope he has not lost his old twinkle. I am
very proud and glad....</p></blockquote>


<p>She was indeed proud of all her son's honors; of any
success of child or grandchild; yet she would pretend
to furious jealousy. "I see your book is praised, Sir!"
(or, "Madam!") "It probably does not deserve it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339b" id="Page_339b">[339]</a></span>
H'm! nobody praises <i>my</i> books!" etc., etc. And all the
time her face so shining with pleasure and tenderness
under the sternly bended brows that the happy child
needed no other praise from any one.</p>

<p>"<i>July 23</i>.... I feel to-day the isolation consequent
upon my long survival of the threescore and ten apportioned
as the term of human life. Brothers and
sisters, friends and fellow-workers, many are now in
the silent land. I am praying for some good work, paying
work, so that I may efficiently help relatives who
need help, and good causes whose demand for aid is
constant...."</p>

<p>"<i>July 24</i>. To-day Harry and Alice Hall have left
me with their two dear children. I have had much delight
with baby Frances, four months old.... I pray
that I may be able to help these children. I looked forward
to their visit as a kindness to them and their
parents, but it has been a great kindness to me...."</p>

<p>"<i>September 5</i>. Some bright moments to-day. At
my prayer a thought of the divine hand reaching down
over the abyss of evil to rescue despairing souls!..."</p>

<p>"<i>September 19</i>. Dear Flossy and Harry left. I shall
miss them dreadfully. She has taken care of me these
many weeks and has been most companionable and
affectionate. My dear boy was as ever very sweet
and kind...."</p>

<p>"<i>September 22</i>. Have puzzled much about my promised
screed for the 'Cosmopolitan' on 'What would be
the Best Gift to the People of the Country?' As I got
out of bed it suddenly occurred to me as 'the glory of
having promoted recognition of human brotherhood.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340b" id="Page_340b">[340]</a></span>
This must include 'Justice to Women.' I meant to
tackle the theme at once, but after breakfast a poem
came to me in the almost vulgar question, 'Does your
Mother know you're out?' I had to write this, also
a verse or two in commemoration of Frederic L.
Knowles, a member of our Authors' Club, who has
just passed away."</p>

<p>"<i>September 25</i>.... I must have got badly chilled
this morning, for my right hand almost refuses to
guide the pen. I tried several times to begin a short
note to David Hall, but could not make distinct letters.
Then I forced myself to pen some rough draft
and now the pen goes better, but not yet quite right.
I had the same experience last winter once. I suppose
that I have overtired my brain; it is a warning...."</p>

<p>"<i>October 5</i>.... I had a moment of visioning, in
which I seemed to see Christ on the cross refusing to
drink the vinegar and gall, and myself to reach up a
golden cup containing 'the love pledge of humanity.'
Coming home I scrawled the verses before lying down
to rest."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>"<i>October 9</i>. After a week of painful anxiety I learn
to-day that my screed for the 'Cosmopolitan' is accepted.
I felt so persuaded to the contrary that I
delayed to open the envelope until I had read all my
other letters...."</p>

<p>"<i>October 25</i>. Meeting of Boston Authors' Club....
Worked all the morning at sorting my letters and
papers.... Laura, Maud, and I drove out to Cambridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341b" id="Page_341b">[341]</a></span>
I had worked hard all the morning, but had
managed to put together a scrap of rhyme in welcome
of Mark Twain. A candle was lit for me to read
by, and afterwards M. T. jumped upon a chair and
made fun, some good, some middling, for some three
quarters of an hour. The effect of my one candle
lighting up his curly hair was good and my rhyme
was well received.</p>

<p>
"<i>Mark</i> the gracious, welcome guest,<br />
Master of heroic jest;<br />
He who cheers man's dull abodes<br />
With the laughter of the gods;<br />
To the joyless ones of earth<br />
Sounds the reveille of mirth.<br />
<br />
"Well we meet, to part with pain,<br />
But ne'er shall <i>he</i> and <i>we</i> be Twain."<br />
</p>

<p>"<i>December 5. Gardiner, Maine.</i> On coming to
breakfast found a note from dearest Maud, saying that
she would sail this day for Spain. Was much overcome
by this intelligence, yet felt that it was on the whole
best. The day passed rather heavily, the relish seemed
gone from everything."</p>

<p>"<i>December 6. Boston</i>.... Reaching home I lay
down to rest, but the feeling of Maud's departure so
overpowered me that I got up and went about, crying
out: 'I can't stand it!' I soon quieted down, being
comforted by my dear Laura, Julia, and Betty, but
could not sleep until bedtime, when I slept soundly."</p>

<p><br />"I pray for many things this year. For myself, I
ask continued health of mind and body, work, useful,
honorable, remunerative, as it shall please God to
send; for my dear family, work of the same description
with comfortable wages, faith in God, and love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343b" id="Page_343b">[343]</a></span>
each other; for my country, that she may keep her
high promise to mankind; for Christendom, that it
may become more Christ-like; for the struggling nationalities,
that they may attain to peace and justice."</p>

<p>"Such a wonderful dream in the early morning. I
was in some rural region alone; the clear blue sky was
over my head. I looked up and said, 'I am fed from
God's table. I am sheltered under His roof.' While
I still felt this joy, a lone man, passing by, broke into
a complaint on the hardness of things. I wanted in my
dream to call him back, but he passed too rapidly. I
still see in my 'mind's eye' that blue sky and the lone
man passing by, I still recall the thrill of that meditation,
literally in Dreamland, as I was quite asleep
when it visited me...."</p>


<p><br />The great event of this winter was a trip to Baltimore
for a Woman Suffrage Convention.</p>

<p>"<i>February 4.</i> I had not been able to think of anything
to say in Baltimore, but this morning it seemed
to come to me. I have just written out my screed, ...
taking a point of view which I do not think I have
presented before, viz.: that inferior education and restricted
activity made women the inferiors of men, as
naturally as training, education, and free agency make
civilized men the superior of the savage. I think that
the dear Lord gave me this screed, which is short and
simple enough, but, I think, convincing...."</p>

<p>This Convention came near being her last. Tonsillitis
was epidemic in the city; the halls were draughty;
at one meeting a woman with a severe cold, a stranger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344b" id="Page_344b">[344]</a></span>
kissed her effusively. She took the infection, was prostrated
for some days, and made the return journey
while still too weak to travel. Florence, who was with
her, protested in vain. "I would go," she said, "<i>if the
hearse was at the door!</i>" A serious illness followed on
her return. A month and more passed before she
began to regain strength and spirits.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>"<i>March 31.</i> Had a happy lighting up when I lay
down for afternoon rest. Felt the immensity of God's
goodness and took heart for the future."</p>

<p>In April she records "a delightful visit from Robert
Collyer, accompanied by Annie Fields. I asked him:
'Robert, what is religion?' He replied, 'To love God
with all one's heart, Christ helping us.' He began his
prayer last Sunday thus: 'Our Father who art in
heaven, on earth, and in hell!'"</p>

<p>On April 13, she was "out for the first time since
February 14, when I returned sick from Baltimore...."</p>

<p>Another week and she was at her church, for the first
time since January 18.</p>

<p>It had been a long and weary time, yet one remembers
not so much the suffering and confinement as the
gayety of it. There was a sigh for the Journal, but for
the family, and the faithful nurse,&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles,<br />
Nods and becks, and wreathéd smiles."<br />
</p>

<p>This nurse was known to others as Lucy Voshell,
but her patient promptly named her "Wollapuk."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345b" id="Page_345b">[345]</a></span>
She was as merry as she was skillful, and the two made
much fun together. Even when the patient could
not speak, she could twinkle. As strength gradually
returned, the ministrations of Wollapuk became positively
scenes of revelry; and the anxious guardian
below, warding off would-be interviewers or suppliants,
might be embarrassed to hear peals of laughter
ringing down the stair.</p>

<p>Early in May she has "young J. W. Hurlburt to
dine; a pleasant young playwright, grandson to General
Hurlburt of the Civil War...."</p>

<p>"I had lent my play of 'Hippolytus' to young Hurlburt
to read. He brought it back yesterday with so
much praise of parts of it as to revive the pang which
I felt when, Charlotte Cushman and Edwin Booth
having promised to fill the principal parts, the manager's
wife suddenly refused to fill her part, and the
whole fell through. This with much other of my best
literary work has remained a dead letter on my own
shelves. I am glad as well as sad to feel that it deserved
better treatment."</p>

<p>She had a wheel-chair, and on pleasant days it
was her delight to be wheeled through the Public
Garden, now in full May beauty, to see the flowers
and the children. She was able to attend several meetings,
and to write several papers.</p>

<p>"<i>May 18.</i> Have read part of the recital of Anna
Ticknor's achievement in her society to encourage
studies at home. Her work is really heroic. I wish that
I had better understood it. Still I did admire it a great
deal, but had little idea of the great benevolence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346b" id="Page_346b">[346]</a></span>
sympathy developed in her work, which was a godsend
to thousands of women."</p>

<p>"<i>May 26.</i> My dear son arrived in the evening to
celebrate my birthday. He seems well and happy. I
was thankful to see him. Flowers kept arriving all
day."</p>

<p>"<i>May 27.</i> Attended church and carried some of
my birthday flowers for the pulpit.... In the
afternoon a beautiful reception which the rain kept
from being the over-crowd which I had rather feared.
Colonel Higginson came and gave me some lovely
verses written for the occasion. William R. Thayer
did likewise. Arthur Upson had already sent me
some. I enjoyed it all very much; dined downstairs
with my dear family, who drank my health standing.
H. M. H., being called upon for a word, said, 'The
dear old girl!' and could not have said better. I
thanked and blessed them all. We passed the evening
together. The Greeks of Boston sent splendid red
roses and ribbons with motto. The Italians sent
flowers."</p>

<p>After this she wrote an essay on "How to Keep
Young," in which she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Try to keep in touch with the best spirits of your
time, with those who are raising instead of lowering
the tone of the atmosphere in which they live.</p>

<p>"Avoid the companionship of those who deride sacred
things and are inclined to ignore the limits of
refinement and good taste.</p>

<p>"Remember that ignoble amusements react upon
character.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347b" id="Page_347b">[347]</a></span>"Never forget that we grow like to that we contemplate.</p>
<p> "Keep it always in mind that it must be through
our own efforts that our progress through life shall
bring with it the fulfilment of the best promise of our
youth."</p>


<p><br />"<i>July 2. Oak Glen.</i> Nurse Voshell, nicknamed by
me Wollapuk, left this morning. I have become so
dependent upon her that I shall miss her very much.
I have been impatient of having her so long, but now
see how very helpful she has been to me.</p>

<p>"I began to write a retrospect of my essay on 'Distinctions
between Philosophy and Religion,' but feel
that this will be of little value. Oh! that I had taken
Dr. Hedge's advice and published these papers soon
after they were written. As it is I have lost two of the
best of them, viz.: this one just mentioned and 'Moral
Triangulation of the Third Party,' in obligations and
contrasts."</p>

<p>In these days she met with a grave loss in the death
of Michael Anagnos.</p>

<p>"I am deeply grieved at his death, which is a real
loss to me and my family, and almost irreparable to the
Institution which he has served nobly with entire devotion
and disinterest and has enriched by his great
and constant efforts. He built three Kindergartens for
the blind. God rest his soul!</p>

<p>"I pray that my great pain at the death of my
son-in-law may inspire me to help the blind as I never
have helped them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348b" id="Page_348b">[348]</a></span>"My strength has failed so much of late that my
strong love of life begins to waver. I should be glad
to live to print some of my studies in Philosophy, and
to have some of my musical compositions taken down
by dictation."</p>

<p>"<i>August 31....</i> The last day of a summer which
brought a serious grief in the death of Michael Anagnos,
who, ever since my visit to Greece in 1867, has been
an important factor in my life. I am much troubled
in the effort to compose a poem to be read at the memorial
services to be held for him in late October...."</p>

<p>A photograph taken at this time shows her sitting
in her hooded chair on the piazza, her Greek books
and her canary beside her, a serene and lovely picture.
It was so she used to sit every morning. First she read
her Testament, and a prayer of James Martineau,
or some other good saint; this she called "taking
the altitude"; then she turned to her Æschylus or
Aristotle.</p>

<p>Before thus settling down, there would be a walk
on the piazza, or along the highway. Sheltered by
a broad hat, the friend of many years, wrapped in
the "passionate pilgrim," as she named a certain
ancient purple cloak, leaning on her ebony stick&mdash;who
that passed that way has not seen her? Bits of
her talk, as we strolled together, come back to us; as
when the clouds parted suddenly at the close of a gray
day, then shutting in again. "Oh!" she cried, "it
is like being engaged to the man you love, for five
minutes!"</p>

<p>"<i>September 16....</i> I had had much hesitation about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349b" id="Page_349b">[349]</a></span>
undertaking to speak at Shiloh Baptist Church [colored]
this afternoon; but it came to me as something
which I ought to do, and so I gave the promise, and,
with some studying, wrote the sermon. The result
fully justified the effort. I spoke to a large and very
attentive congregation, in which a number of white
outsiders were mingled in with the people of the
church.... Mrs. Jeter sang my 'Battle Hymn,' the
congregation joining in the 'Glory Hallelujah.' I then
read my screed, which was heard with profound attention,
one and another crying out at intervals, 'Amen!'
and 'Glory be to God!'... I was very thankful for
the good issue of what had seemed an almost wild
undertaking at eighty-seven years of age."</p>

<p>"<i>October 23.</i> Have prayed and worked over the
poem for Michael's memorial services&mdash;think that I
have made it as good as I can, but not good enough.
Alas! I am too old."</p>

<p>She went up to Boston for this meeting in Tremont
Temple, which was a most impressive one, Greeks and
Americans uniting to do honor to a good man.</p>

<p>"<i>October 24....</i> I read my verse, my voice serving
me very well. Bishop Lawrence helped me both to
rise and to return to my seat. He made a most touching
allusion to my dearest dear Julia's devotion to the
blind, and said where a man was engaged in a noble
work there usually rose up a noble woman to help
him."</p>

<p>"<i>October 26.</i> Had a sudden blessed thought this
morning, viz.: that the 'Tabernacle eternal in the
heavens' is the eternity of truth and right. I naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350b" id="Page_350b">[350]</a></span>
desire life after death, but if it is not granted me, I
have yet a part in the eternal glory of this tabernacle."</p>

<p>"<i>October 29.</i> Dear H. M. H. left us this morning,
after a short but very pleasant visit. He brought here
his decorations of his Russian order to show us; they
are quite splendid. He is the same dear old simple
music- and mischief-loving fellow, very sensitive for
others, very modest for himself, and very dear."</p>

<p>"<i>November 7....</i> Prayed <i>hard</i> this morning that
my strength fail not."</p>

<p>During this summer, an electric elevator had been
put into the Boston house, and life was made much
easier for her. From this time we became familiar
with the vision of her that still abides, flitting up or
down in her gilded car. Watching her ascent, clad in
white, a smile on her lips, her hand waving farewell,
one could only think of "The chariot of Israel and
the horsemen thereof."</p>

<p>Another good gift was a Victor machine. When the
after-dinner reading was over, she would say, "Now
bring my opera-box!"</p>

<p>The white armchair was wheeled into the passage
between the two parlors. Here she sat in state, while
the great singers poured out their treasures before her,
while violinist and pianist gave her their best. She
listened with keen and critical enjoyment, recalling
how Malibran gave this note, how Grisi and Mario
sang that duet. Then she would go to the piano and
play from memory airs from "Tancredi," "Il Pirata,"
"Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion," and other operas known to
us only through her. Or she would&mdash;always without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351b" id="Page_351b">[351]</a></span>
notes&mdash;play the "Barber of Seville" almost from
beginning to end, with fingers still deft and nimble.</p>

<p>She loved the older operas best. After an air from
"Don Giovanni," she would say, "Mozart must be in
heaven: they could never get on without him!" She
thought Handel's "Messiah" the most divine point
reached by earthly music. Beethoven awed and swayed
her deeply, and she often quoted his utterance while
composing, "<i>Ich trat in der Nähe Gottes!</i>" She thrilled
with tender pleasure over Verdi's "<i>Non ti scordar</i>," or
"<i>Ai nostri monti</i>," and over "Martha." She enjoyed
Chopin "almost too much." "He is exquisite," she
would say, "but somehow&mdash;rotten!"</p>

<p>Among the pleasures of this winter was a visit to
New York. She writes after it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My last day in my dear son's house. He and
Fannie have been devotedly kind to me. They made
me occupy their room, much to my bodily comfort,
but to the great disquiet of my mind, as I hated
much to inconvenience them. My son has now a very
eminent position.... God bless the house and all in it."</p>

<p>"<i>December 17.</i> The Old South Chapter of D.A.R.'s
met in the real Old South Church; there was much
good speaking. I recited my 'Battle Hymn' and
boasted my descent from General Marion, the Swamp
Fox, saying also, 'When, eluding the vigilance of children
and grandchildren, I come to such a meeting as
this, without a previous promise not to open my lips,
I think that I show some of the dexterity of my illustrious
relative.' I also had to spring up and tell them
that my grandmother, niece to General Marion, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352b" id="Page_352b">[352]</a></span>
her flannel petticoat to make cartridges for the soldiers
of the Revolution."</p>

<p>The path of the guardian (or jailer, as she sometimes
put it) was not always plain. The wayfaring
woman might easily err therein.</p>

<p>After some severe fatigue, convention or banquet,
she might say, "This is the last time. Never let me do
this again!"</p>

<p>Thereupon a promise would be exacted and made.
The fatigue would pass and be forgotten, and the next
occasion be joyously prepared for.</p>

<p>"You told me not to let you go!" the poor jailer
would say.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean it!"</p>

<p>"But you promised!"</p>

<p>"That was two weeks ago. Two weeks is a long
time for me to keep a promise!"</p>

<p>If the jailer still persisted, she played her last card
and took the trick.</p>

<p>"I can't talk about it. You tire my head!"</p>

<p>Now and then Greek met Greek. One snowy afternoon
she encountered the resident granddaughter,
cloaked and hooded, preparing to brave the storm.</p>

<p>"Dear child," said the grandmother, "I do not
often use authority with you young people, but this
time I must. I cannot allow you to go out in this
blizzard!"</p>

<p>"Dearest grandmother," replied the maiden, "<i>where
are you going yourself</i>?"</p>

<p>There was no reply. The two generations dissolved
in laughter, and started out together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353b" id="Page_353b">[353]</a></span>She bids farewell to 1906 as "dear Year that hast
brought me so many comforts and pleasures!" and
thus hails the New Year:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I earnestly pray for God's blessing on this year!...
I might possibly like one more European journey
to see the Gallery at Madrid, and the châteaux
of Touraine, but I do not ask it, as I may have more
important occupation for my time and money....
<i>Du reste</i>, the dear Father has done so much better
for me, in many ways, than I have ingenuity to wish,
that I can only say, 'Thy will be done, only desert me
not.'"</p>

<p>She determines "at last to be more prompt in response
to letters and bills. I am now apt to lose sight
of them, to my great inconvenience and that of other
people."</p>

<p>It was pain to her to destroy even a scrap of paper
that bore writing: the drifts of notes and letters grew
higher and higher among the piles of books, new and
old. The books were not all her own choice. Many a
firstling of verse found its way to her, inscribed with
reverent or loving words by the author. Would Mrs.
Howe send a few lines of appreciation or criticism?
She would; mostly she did. She wrote in the autograph
albums, and on the pieces of silk and cotton
for "autograph quilts": she signed the photographs:
she tried to do everything they asked.</p>

<p>"<i>January 11.</i> Having hammered at some verses for
General Lee, when I lay down to rest a perfect flood
of rhymes seized me. Nonsense verses for to-morrow's
festival; there seemed to be no end to them. I scrawled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354b" id="Page_354b">[354]</a></span>
some of them down as it was late and dark. Sanborn
to dine&mdash;unexpected, but always welcome."</p>

<p>"<i>January 12.</i> Copied and completed my lines for
the evening. Found a large assemblage of members
and invited guests [of the Authors' Club]; a dais and
chair prepared for me, Colonel Higginson standing on
my right. Many presentations&mdash;Gilder and Clyde
Fitch, Owen Wister, Norman Hapgood. Aldrich
[T. B.] took me in to dinner and sat on my right, Hon.
John D. Long on my left; next beyond A. sat Homans
Womans.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> I despaired of making my jingle tell in so
large and unfamiliar a company. At last I took courage
and read it, bad as I thought it. To my surprise, it
told, and created the merriment which had been my
object so far as I had any. My 'Battle Hymn' was
sung finely by a male quartette. Colonel Higginson
and I were praised almost out of our senses. A calendar,
got up with much labor, was presented to each
of us."</p>

<p>"<i>January 13.</i> To church, to take down my vanity
after last evening's laudations...."</p>

<p>"<i>January 15.</i> Made a final copy of my lines on
Robert E. Lee,&mdash;read them to Rosalind&mdash;the last
line drew a tear from each of us, so I concluded that
it would do and sent it.</p>

<p>"To Tuesday Club, where the effort which I made
to hear speakers tired my head badly. Themes:
'Whether and how to teach Ethics in Public Schools';
also, 'The English Education Bill.' Socrates having
been mentioned as an exemplar, I suddenly cried out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355b" id="Page_355b">[355]</a></span>
that I thought he did wrong to stay and suffer by
unjust laws and popular superstition. A first-class
American would have got away and would have
fought those people to the bitter death. This fiery
little episode provoked laughter, and several privately
told me they were glad of it."</p>

<p>"<i>January 25....</i> Read Colonel Higginson's account
of me in the 'Outlook.' Wrote him a note of thanks,
saying that he has written beautifully, with much tact
and kindness. It remains true that he has not much
acquaintance with the serious side of my life and character,
my studies of philosophy, etc. He has described
what he has seen of me and has certainly done it with
skill and with a most kind intention."</p>

<p>She said of the Colonel's paper, "He does not realize
that my <i>life</i> has been here, the four walls of my
room."</p>

<p>"<i>February 5....</i> Began a sermon on the text, 'I
saw Satan like lightning fall from heaven.'..."</p>

<p>"<i>February 6.</i> Wrote a good bit on the sermon begun
yesterday&mdash;the theme attracts me much. If I give
it, I will have Whittier's hymn sung: 'Oh! sometimes
gleams upon our sight&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Wrote to thank Higginson for sending me word
that I am the first woman member of the society of
American Authors...."</p>

<p>"<i>February 14.</i> Luncheon at 3 Joy Street.... My
seat was between T. W. H. and President Eliot, with
whom I had not spoken in many years. He spoke to
me at once and we shook hands and conversed very
cordially. I had known his father quite well&mdash;a lover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356b" id="Page_356b">[356]</a></span>
of music, who had much to do with the early productions
of Beethoven's Symphonies in Boston, collecting
money in aid of the undertaking. President Eliot made
a good speech for Berea; others followed.... When
my name was called, I had already a good thought to
express."</p>

<p>"<i>February 18.</i> To N.E.W.C., where Colonel Higginson
and I spoke of Longfellow; I from long and intimate
acquaintance, he from a literary point of view.
He said, I thought rightly, that we are too near him
to be able to judge his merits as a poet; time must test
them."</p>

<p>"<i>February 27....</i> In evening went with the Jewett
sisters to the celebration of Longfellow's Centennial.
I had copied my verses written for the first Authors'
Reading <i>in re</i> Longfellow, rather hoping that I might
be invited to read them. This did not happen. I had
had no reason to suppose that it would, not having
been thereunto invited. Had a seat on the platform
among the poet's friends, myself one of the oldest of
them. It seemed as if I could hardly hold my tongue,
which, however, I did. I remembered that God has
given me many opportunities of speaking my thoughts.
If He withheld this one I am bound to suppose it was
for the best. I sat on the platform, where Sarah Jewett
and I were the only women in the charmed circle.</p>

<p>"Item. The audience rose and greeted me as I
ascended to the platform at Sanders Theatre."</p>

<p>She could not bear to be "left out"; indeed, she
rarely was. In this one respect she was, perhaps, the
"spoiled child" that she sometimes called herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357b" id="Page_357b">[357]</a></span>March brought a new pleasure, in seeing and meeting
Novelli, the great Italian actor.</p>

<p>"<i>March 14.</i> The banquet of the Circolo at Lombardy
Inn.... My seat was at the head of the table with
Novelli on my right and Tosti, the consul, on my left.
Had some pleasant talk with each. Then I had a good
inspiration for part of my speech, in which I mentioned
the egg used by Columbus, and made to stand,
to show that things held to be impossible often proved
possible. I said that out of this egg 'was hatched the
American Eagle.' Madame Novelli shed tears at this,
and Novelli kissed my hand. The Italian servants listened
eagerly to all the speaking, and participated in
the applause. President Geddes, Secretary Jocelyn,
and others spoke well and rather briefly. Dear Padre
Roberto was really eloquent."</p>

<p>"<i>March 16....</i> In the evening to see Novelli in
'Morte Civile'; his personation wonderfully fine, surpassing
even Salvini in the part...."</p>

<p>"<i>March 17....</i> Went to South Boston to say a
word at the presentation of dear Michael's portrait to
the Perkins Institution by the Howe Memorial Club....
Also had a wonderful fit of verse&mdash;wrote two
sonnets to Dante and a versification of my conceit
about the hatching of the American Eagle from the
egg of Columbus."</p>

<p>"<i>March 23.</i> A 'boot-and-saddle' day.... I found
that my Authors' Club will meet to-day in Cambridge.
Higginson telephoned, asking me to speak of Aldrich;
I asked permission to leave the College Club after the
speaking. Ordered a carriage at 4.30, sprang into it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358b" id="Page_358b">[358]</a></span>
and reached the Authors' meeting in good time to say
something about Aldrich.... Found a man who has
studied the Berber races in Africa. Had a good talk
with him. Came home dreadfully tired. To bed by
9.30. At the College Club I said that to give women
the vote in this State would not double the illiterate
vote&mdash;proposed a census of comparative illiteracy of
the sexes in Massachusetts at least."</p>

<p><br />We had long besought her to have her musical
compositions written down, and now this was done in
part. Once or twice a week Mr. John M. Loud came
to the house and took down her melodies, she singing
and playing them to him. She always enjoyed the
hour with the young composer. A number of the
melodies thus preserved were published in a "Song
Album" by G. Schirmer some months later.</p>

<p>"<i>April 8.</i> Great trouble of mind about attending the
Peace Convention in New York, which I have promised
to do. Laura dead against it, reinforced by Wesselhoeft,
Sr., who pronounces it dangerous for me. I at
last wrote to ask my dear minister about it."</p>

<p>"<i>April 9....</i> A violent snowstorm keeps me at
home. Minister and wife write, 'Don't go to Peace
Convention.' I asked God in my prayer this morning
to make going possible or impossible for me. I took
C. G. A.'s letter as making it impossible, as I had
decided to abide by his decision. Wrote a letter of explanation
to Anna Garlin Spencer. I am much disappointed,
but it is a relief not to cause Laura such painful
anxiety as she would have felt if I had decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359b" id="Page_359b">[359]</a></span>
go. She wept with joy when I gave it up. We had a
very pleasant dinner party for the Barrett Wendells
with their friends, Professor Ames, of Berkeley University,
California, 'Waddy' Longfellow, Charles Gibson,
Laura, Betty, and I."</p>

<p>She sent a letter to the Convention, which was read
by Florence. In this, after recalling her Peace Crusade
of 1872, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here and there, a sisterly voice responded to my
appeal, but the greater number said: 'We have neither
time nor money that we can call our own. We cannot
travel, we cannot meet together.' And so my intended
Peace Congress of Women melted away like a dream,
and my final meeting, held in the world's great metropolis,
did not promise to lead to any important result.</p>

<p>"What has made the difference between that time
and this? New things, so far as women are concerned,
viz.: the higher education conceded to them, and the
discipline of associated action, with which later years
have made them familiar. Who shall say how great an
element of progress has existed in this last clause?
Who shall say what fretting of personal ambition has
become merged in the higher ideal of service to the
State and to the world? The noble army of women
which I saw as a dream, and to which I made my appeal,
has now come into being. On the wide field where
the world's great citizens band together to uphold the
highest interests of society, women of the same type
employ their gifts and graces to the same end. Oh,
happy change! Oh, glorious metamorphosis! In less
than half a century the conscience of mankind has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360b" id="Page_360b">[360]</a></span>
made its greatest stride toward the control of human
affairs. The women's colleges and the women's clubs
have had everything to do with the great advance
which we see in the moral efficiency of our sex. These
two agencies have been derided and decried, but they
have done their work.</p>

<p>"If a word of elderly counsel may become me at
this moment, let me say to the women here assembled:
Do not let us go back from what we have gained. Let
us, on the contrary, press ever forward in the light of
the new knowledge, of the new experience. If we have
rocked the cradle, if we have soothed the slumbers of
mankind, let us be on hand at their great awakening
to make steadfast the peace of the world!"</p>

<p>She was glad afterward that she had not gone;
but a significant corollary to the matter appears on
April 25:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Providence&mdash;a pleasant trip, made possible by
dear Laura's departure."</p>

<p>(That is, "dear Laura" knew nothing about it till
afterward. How often we recalled the old Quaker's
saying to her, "It was borne in upon me at an early
period that if I told no one what I intended to do, I
should be enabled to do it!")</p>

<p>In the last week of April ("dear Laura" being still
absent) she spoke four times in public, on four successive
days. These addresses were at the Kindergarten
for the Blind ("I missed the snap which Michael's
presence was wont to give; I spoke praise of him to
the children, as one to be held in dear remembrance;
to the visitors, as having left the public a sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361b" id="Page_361b">[361]</a></span>
legacy in these schools, which he created with so much
labor"), at Faneuil Hall, a meeting about Old Home
Week, at the West Newton High School, and at Providence.
On the fifth day she was at the Wintergreen
Club, answering the question, "What is the Greatest
Evil of the Present Day?"&mdash;"False estimates of
values, vehement striving for what hinders rather than
helps our spiritual development."</p>

<p>After this bout she was glad to rest a day or two,
but in another week was ready for the Woman Suffrage
Festival. "I to open it, evening, Faneuil Hall. A day
of rushing. Lady Mary and Professor Gilbert Murray
to breakfast 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, which I much enjoyed. Then my
little music man, who took three tunes; then a snatch
at preparation for the evening's exercises. Jack and
Elizabeth Chapman in the afternoon. At 4.45 got a
little rest and sleep. At 5.40 drove to Faneuil Hall,
which I found not so full as sometimes. Thought miserably
of my speech. Light to read it very dim. I
called to order, introduced Mr. White and the ladies'
quartette, then read my poor little scribble.... I was
thankful to get through my part, and my speech in
print wasn't bad at all."</p>

<p>In May she preached at the Church of the Disciples.</p>

<p>"A culmination of anxiety for this day, desired
and yet dreaded. My head growled a little at waking,
but not badly. My voice seemed all right, but how
about the matter of my sermon? Was it all worth
while, and on Whitsunday too? I wore my white cashmere
dress. Laura went with me to church. C. G. A.
was there. As he led me to the pulpit, the congregation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362b" id="Page_362b">[362]</a></span>
rose. The service was very congenial and calming to
my anxiety. I read the sermon quite audibly from
beginning to end. It was listened to with profound
attention, if I may say so."</p>

<p>"<i>May 20....</i> Marion Crawford arrived soon after
three for a little visit. He looks greatly improved in
health since I last saw him. He must have passed
through some crisis and come out conqueror. He has
all his old charm...."</p>

<p>She was lamenting the death of her cousin and childhood
playfellow, Dr. Valentine Mott Francis, when
"a much greater affliction" fell upon her in the death
of her son-in-law, David Prescott Hall. "This hurts
me," she writes, "like a physical pain."</p>

<p>You are quite right in saying that we greatly need
the consoling belief in a future life to help us bear the
painful separation which death brings. Surely, the
dear Christ believed in immortality, and promised it
to faithful souls. I have myself derived great comfort
from this belief, although I must confess that I know
nothing about it. You may remember what [Downer]
said to your dear father: "I don't know anything about
it, but Jesus Christ certainly believed in immortality,

<p><br />Much work was on hand this summer: a poem for
Old Home Week in Boston, another for the Cooperstown
Centennial, a paper on the "Elegant Literature
of Fifty Years Since," one for the "Delineator" on
"The Three Greatest Men I Have Known." These
were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Theodore Parker, and
Dr. Howe. She spent much time and pains on this
article. She read Elliot Cabot's "Life of Emerson,"
which she thought "certainly a good piece of work,
but deficient, it seems to me, in the romantic sympathy
which is the true interpretation of Emerson and of all
his kind."</p>

<p>She "hammered" hard on the two poems, with good
results.</p>

<p>"<i>July 14.</i> I can hardly believe it, but my miserable
verses, re-read to-day, seemed quite possible, if I can
have grace to fill out their sketchiness. Last word ton-ight:
I think I have got a poem. <i>Nil desperandum!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>July 24.</i> Difficult to exaggerate the record of my
worry this morning. I feel a painful uncertainty about
going to Boston to read my poem for Old Home
Week. Worse than this is my trouble about two
poems sent me while in Boston, with original music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364b" id="Page_364b">[364]</a></span>
to be presented to the committee for Home Week,
which I have entirely forgotten and neglected. To do
this was far from my intention, but my old head fairly
gave out in the confusion of the various occasions in
which I was obliged to take an active part."</p>

<p>She yielded to entreaty and stayed at home, and
was rewarded by "a most gratifying letter from Edward
Everett Hale, telling me that Josiah Quincy read
my poem with real feeling, and that it was warmly
received."</p>

<p>"My prayer is answered. I have lived to see my
dear girl again.... I give thanks earnestly and heartily,
but seem for a time paralyzed by her presence."</p>

<p>With the early autumn came a great pleasure in a
visit to the new "Green Peace," the house which her
son had built at Bedford Hills, New York. She was
delighted with the house and garden; the Journal tells
of all manner of pleasant gayeties.</p>

<p>"<i>September 12.</i> Fannie had a luncheon party even
pleasanter than yesterday's. Rev. Mr. Luquer is a
grandson of Dominick Lynch, who used to come to my
father's house in my childhood and break my heart by
singing 'Lord Ullin's Daughter.' I remember creeping
under the piano once to hide my tears. He sang all the
Moore melodies with great expression.... This, his
descendant, looks a good deal like him. Was bred a
lawyer. My good Uncle Cutler twice asked him
whether he would study for the ministry. He said,
'No.' My uncle said the second time, 'What shall it
profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his
own soul?' This word, he told me, came back to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365b" id="Page_365b">[365]</a></span>
... Worked a good deal on my poem. At least thought
and thought much, and altered a little."</p>

<p>This was the poem which prefaces this chapter and
which was written for the forthcoming Unitarian Convention
in Boston. She had been at work on it for
some time, first "<i>trying to try for it</i>," and later "hammering"
and polishing with great care. "It came to
me like a flash," she says, "but had to be much thought
over and corrected." And again, "It was given to
me something as was my 'Battle Hymn.'..."</p>

<p>"<i>October 25.</i> Wrote to a very bumptious child,
thirteen years old, who proffers me her friendship and
correspondence, claiming to have written poems and
magazine contributions praised by 'noted authors.'
I sent her back her letter, with three or four corrections
and a little advice, kindly meant, but which may not
be so taken.... She will probably turn and rend me,
but I really felt it might do her good."</p>

<p>"<i>November 14. Gardiner.</i> A good meditation. The
sense of God in the universe seems to be an attribute
of normal humanity. We cannot think of our own
personal identity without at the same time imagining
a greater self from which we derive. This idea may be
crude and barbarous, great minds have done much to
make it otherwise; Christ most of all with His doctrine
of divine love, providence, and forgiveness. The idea
of a life beyond this one seems also to appertain to
normal humanity. We had best accept this great endowment
which philosophy seeks to analyze much as
a boy will take a watch to pieces, but cannot put it
together again so that it will work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366b" id="Page_366b">[366]</a></span>"<i>November 15.</i> Another long sitting and meditation.
What have individual philosophers done for religion?
As I recall what I could learn of the Kantian philosophy,
I think that it principally taught the limitations
of human knowledge, correcting thereby the assumptions
of systems of thought and belief to <i>absolute</i> authority
over the thinker and believer. He calls conscience
'the categorical imperative'; but that term in
no wise explains either the origin or authority of the
moral law. His rule of testing the rectitude of the act
by the way in which, if it were made universal, it would
affect the well-being of society, is useful, but simply
pragmatic, not in William James's sense. The German
idealism, the theory by which we evolve or create all
that occupies our senses and our mind, appears to me
a monstrous expanse of egotism. No doubt, dialectics
serve as mental athletics, and speculative thought may
be useful as an exercise of the mental powers; but processes
which may be useful in this way might be very
unfit to be held as permanent possessions of persuasion.
It occurs to me that it might be more blessed to
help the souls in hell than to luxuriate with saints in
heaven."</p>

<p>"<i>November 20. Boston.</i> Began my screed on the
'Joys of Motherhood' for the 'Delineator.' Wrote
<i>currente calamo</i>...."</p>

<p>"<i>November 23.</i> Rather an off day. Found T. W.
Higginson's little volume of verses, presented to me
on my seventieth birthday, and read a good deal in it.
When the Colonel gave it to me, he read a little poem,
'Sixty and Six,' very charmingly. Seems to me that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367b" id="Page_367b">[367]</a></span>
ought to have read this little book through long before
this time. One of the sweetest poems in it is about
the blue-eyed baby that they lost after some six weeks'
happy possession. I sent a pretty little baby wreath
for it, feeling very sorry for them both."</p>

<p>"<i>November 28.</i> Much troubled about my Whittier
poem."</p>

<p>"<i>December 3.</i> Thanks be to God! I have written
my Whittier rhyme. It has cost me much labor, for I
have felt that I could not treat a memory so reverend
with cheap and easy verses. I have tried to take his
measure, and to present a picture of him which shall
deserve to live."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>


<p><br />Mr. and Mrs. Cobden-Sanderson, the English suffragists,
were in Boston this winter. They dined with
her, and proved "very agreeable. Mrs. Sanderson's
visit ought to help suffrage mightily, she is in such
dead earnest for it. After dinner I proposed that
each one should name his favorite Browning poem.
I named 'Pippa,' Mrs. Sanderson 'Paracelsus,' Mr. S.,
'The Grammarian's Funeral,' etc., etc. The talk was
so good that we could not stop it to hear the Victor,
which I regretted."</p>

<p>Another delightful dinner of this winter was one
given in her honor by her niece, Mrs. Richard Aldrich
(Margaret Chanler), in New York. Among the guests
were Kneisel, the violinist, and Schelling, the pianist.
Mrs. Aldrich demanded "Flibbertigibbet," and our
mother played and recited it in such a manner that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368b" id="Page_368b">[368]</a></span>
two musicians were inspired to play, as the people in
the story were to dance. Kneisel flew home for his
violin, Schelling sat down at the piano, and the two
played Bach for her and to her delight.</p>

<p>"The occasion was memorable!" she says.</p>

<p>Returning from New York, she was able to attend
the Whittier Centennial at Haverhill.</p>

<p>"<i>December 17.</i> ... Sanborn came to take me.... I
have been praying to be well for this occasion, my
last public engagement for some weeks. I am thankful
to have been able, at my advanced age, to read this
poem at the Whittier Celebration and to be assured
by one present that I had never been in better voice,
and by others that I was generally heard without difficulty
by the large audience."</p>

<p>"<i>December 31.</i> Oh, blessed year 1907! It has been
granted me to write four poems for public occasions,
all of which have proved acceptable; also three fatiguing
magazine articles, which have for the time
bettered my finances. I have lived in peace and goodwill
with all men, and in great contentment with my
own family, to which this year added a promising
little great-grandson, taking away, alas! my dear son-in-law,
David Prescott Hall. I found a very competent
and friendly young musician who has taken down
nearly all my songs.... A word was given me to
speak, namely, 'Thanks for the blessed, wonderful
year just past.'"</p>

<p><br />The grandchildren were her chief playmates when
Maud was in Europe. To them, the grave tone of the
Journal, the tale of her public work, is almost unbelievable,
recalling, as they do, the household life, so
warm, so rich, so intimate, it seemed enough in itself
to fill the cup to overflowing. She had said of herself
that in social activities she "bled at every pore": but
in these later years it was light and warmth that she
shed around her, kindling whatever she touched. At
her fire, as at Uncle Sam's, we warmed our hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370b" id="Page_370b">[370]</a></span>
our hearts. When she entered a room, all faces lighted
up, as if she carried a lamp in her hand.</p>

<p>Day in, day out, she was the <i>Guter Camerad</i>. The
desire <i>not to irritate</i> had become so much a second
nature that she was the easiest person in the world to
live with. If the domestic calm were disturbed, "<i>Don't
say anything!</i>" was her word. "<i>Wait a little!</i>"</p>

<p>She might wake with the deep depression so often
mentioned in the Journal. Pausing at her door to
listen, one might hear a deep sigh, a plaintive ejaculation;
but all this was put out of sight before she left
her room, and she came down, as one of the grandchildren
put it, "bubbling like a silver tea-kettle."</p>

<p>Then came the daily festival of breakfast, never to
be hurried or "scamped." The talk, the letters, some
of which we might read to her, together with the
newspaper. We see her pressing some tidbit on a child,
watching intently the eating of it, then, as the last
mouthful disappeared, exclaiming with tragic emphasis,
"<i>I wanted it!</i>" Then, at the startled face, would
come peals of laughter; she would throw herself back
in her chair, cover her face with her hands, and tap
the floor with her feet.</p>

<p>"Look at her!" cried Maud. "<i>Rippling with sin!</i>"</p>

<p>How she loved to laugh!</p>

<p>"One day," says a granddaughter, "the house was
overflowing with guests, and she asked me to take my
nap on her sofa, while she took hers on the bed. We
both lay down in peace and tranquillity, but after a
while, when she thought I was asleep, I heard her
laughing, until she almost wept. Presently she fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371b" id="Page_371b">[371]</a></span>
asleep, and slept her usual twenty minutes, to wake
in the same gales of mirth. She laughed until the bed
shook, but softly, trying to choke her laughter, lest I
should wake.</p>

<p>"'What is it about?' I asked. 'What is so wonderful
and funny?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, my dear,' she said, breaking again into
laughter, 'it is nothing! It is the most ridiculous
thing! I was only trying to translate "fiddle-de-dee"
into Greek!'"</p>

<p>This was in her ninety-second year.</p>

<p>But we are still at the breakfast table. Sometimes
there were guests at breakfast, a famous actor, a travelling
scholar, caught between other engagements for
this one leisure hour.</p>

<p>It was a good deal, perhaps, to ask people to leave
a warm hotel on a January morning; but it was
warm enough by the soft-coal blaze of the dining-room
fire. Over the coffee and rolls, sausages and
buckwheat cakes, leisure reigned supreme; not the
poet's "retired leisure," but a friendly and laughter-loving
deity. Everybody was full of engagements,
harried with work, pursued by business and pleasure:
no matter! the talk ranged high and far, and the
morning was half gone before they separated.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast came the game of ball, played
<i>à deux</i> with daughter or grandchild; the ball was tossed
back and forth, the players counting meanwhile up to
ten in various languages. She delighted in adding to her
vocabulary of numerals, and it was a good day when
she mastered those of the Kutch-Kutch Esquimaux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372b" id="Page_372b">[372]</a></span>Then came the walk, gallantly taken in every
weather save the very worst. She battled with the
west wind, getting the matter over as quickly as might
be. "<i>It is for my life!</i>" she would say. But on quiet,
sunny days she loved to linger along Commonwealth
Avenue, watching the parade of babies and little children,
stopping to admire this one or chat with that.</p>

<p>This function accomplished, she went straight to
her desk, and "P. T." reigned till noon. It was a less
rigorous "P. T." than that of our childhood. She could
break off in a moment now, give herself entirely, joyously,
to the question of dinner for the expected guest,
of dress for the afternoon reception, then drop back
into Aristotle or Æschylus with a happy sigh. It was
less easy to break off when she was writing; we might
be begged for "half a moment," as if our time were
fully as precious as her own; but there was none of the
distress that interruption brought in earlier years.
Perhaps she took her writing less seriously. She often
said, "Oh, my dear, I am beginning to realize at last
that I shall never write my book now, my Magnum
Opus, that was to be so great!"</p>

<p>She practised her scales faithfully every day,
through the later years. Then she would play snatches
of forgotten operas, and the granddaughter would hear
her&mdash;if she thought no one was near&mdash;singing the
brilliant <i>arias</i> in "a sweet thread of a voice."</p>

<p>After her practising, if she were alone, she would sit
at the window and play her Twilight Game: counting
the "passing," one for a biped, two for a quadruped,
ten for a white horse, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373b" id="Page_373b">[373]</a></span>In the evening, before the "Victor" concert, came the
reading aloud: this was one of her great pleasures.
No history or philosophy for the evening reading; she
must have a novel (not a "problem novel"; these she
detested!)&mdash;a good stirring tale, with plenty of action
in it. She thrilled over "With Fire and Sword,"
"Kim," "The Master of Ballantrae." She could not
bear to hear of financial anxieties or of physical suffering.
"It gives me a pain in my knee!"</p>

<p>We see her now, sitting a little forward in her
straight-backed chair, holding the hand of the reading
granddaughter, alert and tense. When a catastrophe
appears imminent, "Stop a minute!" she cries. "I
cannot bear it!"&mdash;and the reader must pause while
she gathers courage to face disaster with the hero,
or dash with him through peril to safety.</p>

<p>She would almost be sorry when the doorbell announced
a visitor; almost, not quite, for flesh and
blood were better than fiction. If the caller were a
familiar friend, how her face lighted up!</p>

<p>"Oh! now we can have whist!"</p>

<p>The table is brought out, the mother-of-pearl counters
(a Cutler relic: we remember that Mr. Ward did
not allow cards in his house!), and the order for the
rest of the evening is "A clear fire, a clean hearth, and
the rigor of the game!"&mdash;</p>

<p>It was a happy day when, as chanced once or
twice, Mr. Ernest Schelling, coming on from New
York to play with the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
offered to come and play to her, "all by herself, whatever
she wanted, and for as long as she liked." She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374b" id="Page_374b">[374]</a></span>
never forgot this pleasure, nor the warm kindness of
the giver.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Abel Lefranc, the French lecturer of
the year at Harvard, came to lunch with her. He
apologized for only being able to stay for the luncheon
hour, owing to a press of engagements and work that
had grown overpowering. He stayed for two hours and
a half after luncheon was over, and during all that
time the flow of poignant, brilliant talk, <i>à deux</i>, held
the third in the little company absorbed. She was
entirely at home in French, and the Frenchman talked
over the problems of his country as if to a compatriot.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards a Baptist minister from
Texas, a powerfully built and handsome man, came
to wait on her. He also stayed two hours: and we
heard his "Amen!" and "Bless the Lord for that!"
and her gentler "Bless the Lord, indeed, my brother!"
as their voices, fervent and grave, mingled in talk.</p>

<p>She never tried to be interested in people. She <i>was</i>
interested, with every fibre of her being. Little household
doings: the economies and efforts of brave young
people, she thrilled to them all. Indeed, all <i>human
facts</i> roused in her the same absorbed and reverent
interest.</p>

<p>These are Boston memories, but those of Oak Glen
are no less tender and vivid. There, too, the meals
were festivals, the midday dinner being now the chief
one, with its following hour on the piazza; "Grandmother"
in her hooded chair, with her cross-stitch
embroidery or "hooked" rug, daughters and grandchildren
gathered round her. Horace and Xenophon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375b" id="Page_375b">[375]</a></span>
were on the little table beside her, but they must wait
till she had mixed and enjoyed her "social salad."</p>

<p>At Oak Glen, too, she had her novel and her whist,
bézique or dominoes, as the family was larger or
smaller. She never stooped to solitaire; a game must
be an affair of companionship, of the "social tie" in
defence of which "Bro' Sam," in his youth, had professed
himself ready to die. Instead of the "Victor"
concert, she now made music herself, playing four-hand
pieces with Florence, the "music daughter,"
trained in childhood by Otto Dresel. This was another
great pleasure. (Did any one, we wonder, ever <i>enjoy</i>
pleasures as she did?) These duets were for the afternoon;
she almost never used her eyes in the evening.
They were perfectly good, strong eyes; in the latter
years she rarely used glasses; but the habit dated back
to the early fifties, and might not be shaken.</p>

<p>We see her, therefore, in the summer afternoons,
sitting at the piano with Florence, playing, "Galatea,
dry thy tears!" "Handel's old tie-wig music," as she
called his operas. Or, if her son were there, she would
play accompaniments from the "Messiah" or "Elijah";
rippling through the difficult music, transposing
it, if necessary to suit the singer's voice, with ease and
accuracy. Musicians said that she was the ideal accompanist,
never asserting herself, but giving perfect
sympathy and support to the singer.</p>

<p>We return to the Journal.</p>

<p>"<i>January, 1908.</i> I had prayed the dear Father to
give me this one more poem, a verse for this year's
Decoration Day, asked for by Amos Wells, of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376b" id="Page_376b">[376]</a></span>
Endeavor belonging. I took my pen and the
poem came quite spontaneously. It seemed an answer
to my prayer, but I hold fast the thought that the
great Christ asked <i>no sign</i> from God and needed none,
so deeply did he enter into life divine. I also thought,
regarding Christ and Moses, that we must be content
that a certain mystery should envelop these heroic
figures of human history. Our small measuring tape
or rod is not for them. If they were not exactly in fact
what we take them to be, let us deeply reverence the
human mind which has conceived and built up such
splendid and immortal ideals. Was not Christ thinking
of something like this when he made the sin against
the Holy Ghost and its manifestations the only unpardonable
error? He surely did not mean to say that
it was beyond the repentance which is the earnest of
forgiveness to every sin."</p>

<p>A day or two after this she met at luncheon "a
young Reverend Mr. Fitch.... He is earnest and
clear-minded, and should do much good. I spoke of
the cup [of life], but advised him to use the spoon for
stirring up his congregation."</p>

<p>She was asked for a "long and exhaustive paper on
Marion Crawford in about a week. I wrote, saying that
I could furnish an interesting paper on the elder and
younger Crawford, but without any literary estimate
of Marion's work, saying that family praise was too
much akin to self-praise; also the time allotted much
too short."</p>

<p>One night she woke "suddenly and something
seemed to say, 'They are on the right tack now.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377b" id="Page_377b">[377]</a></span>
This microscopic and detailed study of the causes of
evil on society will be much forwarded by the direct
agency of women. They too will supply that inexhaustible
element of hopefulness, without which reforms
are a mere working back and forth of machinery.
These two things will overcome the evil of the world
by prevention first, and then by the optimistic anticipation
of good. This is a great work given to
Woman now to do. Then I caught at various couplets
of a possible millennial poem, but feared I
should not write it. Have scrawled these on a large
pad. This line kept coming back to me, 'Living, not
dying, Christ redeemed mankind.'... This my first
day at my desk since Saturday, March 28. I may try
some prose about the present patient analysis of the
evil of society, the patient intelligent women associated
in all this work. To reclaim waste earth is a glory.
Why not a greater to reclaim the moral wastes of
humanity?"</p>

<p>This midnight vision impressed her deeply, and
through the succeeding days she wrote it out in full,
bit by bit. On the envelope containing it is written,
"An account of my vision of the world regenerated
by the combined labor and love of Men and Women."
In it she saw "men and women of every clime
working like bees to unwrap the evils of society and
to discover the whole web of vice and misery and
to apply the remedies, and also to find the influences
that should best counteract the evil and its attendant
suffering.</p>

<p>"There seemed to be a new, a wondrous, ever-permeating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378b" id="Page_378b">[378]</a></span>
light, the glory of which I cannot attempt
to put into human words&mdash;the light of the newborn
hope and sympathy&mdash;blazing. The source of this
light was born of human endeavor...."</p>

<p>She saw "the men and the women, standing side
by side, shoulder to shoulder, a common lofty and indomitable
purpose lighting every face with a glory
not of this earth. All were advancing with one end
in view, one foe to trample, one everlasting goal to
gain....</p>

<p>"And then I saw the victory. All of evil was gone
from the earth. Misery was blotted out. Mankind
was emancipated and ready to march forward in a
new Era of human understanding, all-encompassing
sympathy and ever-present help, the Era of perfect
love, of peace passing understanding."</p>


<p><br />Mrs. Humphry Ward was in Boston this spring, and
there were many pleasant festivities in her honor.</p>

<p>A "luncheon with Mrs. Humphry Ward at Annie
Fields'; very pleasant. Edward Emerson there, easy
and delightful...."</p>

<p>A fine reception at the Vendôme, where she and
Mrs. Ward stood under "a beautiful arch of roses"
and exchanged greetings.</p>

<p>"A delightful call from Mrs. Humphry Ward. We
had much talk of persons admired in England and
America. She has great personal attraction, is not
handsome, but very '<i>simpatica</i>' and is evidently whole-souled
and sincere, with much 'good-fellowship.' We
embraced at parting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379b" id="Page_379b">[379]</a></span>In strong contrast to this is her comment on a
writer whose work did not appeal to her. "But she
has merit; yes, she certainly has merit. In fact&mdash;"
with a flash&mdash;"she is meret-ricious!"</p>

<p>May brought the Free Religious Banquet, at which
she "compared the difference of sect to the rainbow
which divides into its beauty the white light of truth";
and the State Federation of Women's Clubs, where
another apt comparison occurred to her.</p>

<p>"I compared the old order among women to the
juxtaposition of squares set cornerwise to each other;
the intensity of personal feeling and interest infusing
an insensible antagonism into our relations with each
other. 'Now,' I said, 'the comparison being removed,
we no longer stand cornerwise to each other, but so
that we can fit into line, and stand and act in concert.'..."</p>

<p>"<i>Newport.</i> I begin to feel something of the 'labor
and sorrow' of living so long. I don't even enjoy my
books as I used to. My efforts to find a fit word for
the Biennial [of the General Federation of Women's
Clubs, to meet in Boston, June 22 and 23] are not
successful...."</p>

<p>She soon revived under her green trees, and enjoyed
her books as much as ever: "got hold of" her
screed, wrote it, went up to Boston to deliver it, came
back to meet an excursion party of "Biennial" ladies
visiting Newport. (N.B. She was late for the reception,
and her neighbor, Bradford Norman, drove her
into Newport in his automobile "at a terrific clip."
On alighting, "Braddie," she said, "if I were ten years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380b" id="Page_380b">[380]</a></span>
younger, I would set up one of these hell-wagons myself!")</p>

<p>She enjoyed all this hugely, but the fatigue was followed
by distress so great that the next morning she
"thought she should die with her door locked." (She
<i>would</i> lock her door: no prayers of ours availed against
this. In Boston, an elaborate arrangement of keys
made it possible for her room to be entered; at Oak
Glen there was but the one stout door. On this occasion,
after lying helpless and despairing for some time,
she managed to unlock the door and call the faithful
maid.)</p>

<p>On June 30 she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, beautiful last day of June! Perhaps my last
June on earth.... I shall be thankful to live as long
as I can be of comfort or help to any one...."</p>

<p>"<i>July 12....</i> Sherman to Corse [Civil War], 'Can
you hold out till I arrive?' Corse to Sherman, 'I have
lost an arm, my cheekbone, and am minus one ear,
but I can lick <i>all hell</i> yet.'"</p>

<p>"<i>July 30.</i> Have felt so much energy to-day that
thought I must begin upon my old philosophizing
essays.... Could find only 'Duality of Character.'
What is the lesson of this two-foldness? This, that the
most excellent person should remember the dual member
of his or her firm, the evil possibility; and the most
persistent offender should also remember the better
personality which is bound up with its opposite, and
which can come into activity, if invited to do so."</p>

<p>"<i>August 28.</i> Wrote an immediate reply to a Mrs.
&mdash;&mdash;, who had written to ask leave to use a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381b" id="Page_381b">[381]</a></span>
of my 'Battle Hymn' with some verses of her own.
I replied, refusing this permission, but saying that
she should rewrite her own part sufficiently to leave
mine out, and should not call it the 'Battle Hymn
of the Republic.' The metre and tune, of course,
she might use, as they are not mine in any special
sense, but my phrases <i>not</i>."</p>

<p>After writing an article for the "Delineator," on
"What I should like to give my Country for a Christmas
Gift," she dreads a failure of her productive
power, but is reassured by Maud's verdict. "I took
much pains with it, but think she overpraises it a little
to raise my spirits." The gift she would choose was
"a more vigilant national conscience." The little essay
counts but seventy lines, but every word tells.</p>

<p>In early September she performed a "very small
public service," unveiling in Newport a bronze tablet
in honor of Count de Rochambeau. She would have
been glad to speak, but an anxious daughter had
demurred, and at the moment she "only thought of
pulling the string the right way."</p>

<p>"<i>September 21. Green Peace, New York.</i> A delightful
drive with Mr. Seth Low in his auto. A good talk with
him about the multi-millionnaires and the Hague Conferences
which he has attended. We reached Green
Peace in time for Mr. Frank Potter to sing about half
of my songs. He has a fine tenor voice, well cultivated,
and is very kind about my small compositions. I had
not counted upon this pleasure. I dreaded this visit, for
the troublesome journey, but it has been delightful.
I am charmed to see my son so handsomely and comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382b" id="Page_382b">[382]</a></span>
established, and with a very devoted wife.
Potter brought me some flowers and a curious orchid
from Panama."</p>

<p>"<i>November 3. Oak Glen.</i> Yesterday and to-day have
had most exquisite sittings in front of my house in the
warm sunshine; very closely wrapped up by the dear
care of my daughters."</p>

<p>These sittings were on what she called her boulevard,
a grassy space in front of the house, bordering on the
road, and taking the full strength of the morning sun.
Here, with the tall screen of cedars behind her, and a
nut tree spreading its golden canopy over her head, she
would sit for hours, drinking in the sweet air that was
like no other to her.</p>

<p>A companion picture to this is that of the twilight
hour, when she would sit alone in the long parlor,
looking out on the sunset. Black against the glowing
sky rose the pines of the tiny forgotten graveyard,
where long-ago neighbors slept, with the white rose
tree drooping over the little child's grave; a spot of
tender and melancholy beauty. All about were the
fields she loved, fragrant with clover and wormwood,
vocal with time-keeping crickets. Here she would sit
for an hour, meditating, or repeating to herself the
Odes of Horace, or some familiar hymn. Horace was
one of her best friends, all her life long. She knew
many of the Odes by heart, and was constantly memorizing
new ones. They filled and brightened many
a sleepless or weary hour. Here, when the children
came back from their walk, they would find her, quiet
and serene, but ready instantly to break into laughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383b" id="Page_383b">[383]</a></span>
with them, to give herself, as always, entirely and
joyously. Now and then she wrote down a meditation;
here is one:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A thought comes to me to-day which gives me
great comfort. This is that, while the transitory incidentals
of our life, important for the moment, pass out
of it, the steadfast divine life which is in our earthly
experience, perseveres, and can never die nor diminish.
I feel content that much of me should die. I
interpret for myself Christ's parable of the tares sown
in the wheat field. As regards the individual, these
tares are our personal and selfish traits and limitations.
We must restrain and often resist them, but we cannot
and must not seek to eradicate them, for they are
important agents not only in preserving, but also in
energizing our bodily life. Yet they are, compared
with our higher life, as the tares compared with the
wheat, and we must be well content to feel that, when
the death harvest comes, these tares will fall from us
and perish, while the wheat will be gathered into the
granary of God.</p>

<p>"I do not desire ecstatic, disembodied sainthood,
because I do not wish to abdicate any one of the attributes
of my humanity. I cherish even the infirmities
that bind me to my kind. I would be human, and
American, and a woman. Paul of Tarsus had one or
two ecstasies, but I feel sure that he lived in his humanity,
strenuously and energetically. Indeed, the list
he gives us of his trials and persecutions may show us
how much he lived as a man among men, even though
he did once cry out for deliverance from the body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384b" id="Page_384b">[384]</a></span>
death, whose wants and pains were a sore hindrance
to him in his unceasing labors. That deliverance he
found daily in the service of Truth, and finally once
for all, when God took him.</p>

<p>"Another thought upholds me. With the recurrence
of the cycle, I feel the steady tramp and tread of the
world's progress. This Spring is not identical with last
Spring, this year is not last year. The predominant
fact of the Universe is not the mechanical round and
working of its forces, but their advance as moral life
develops out of and above material life. Mysterious
as the chain of causation is, we know one thing about
it, viz.: that we cannot reverse its sequence. Whatever
may change or pass away, my father remains my
father, my child, my child. The way before us is open&mdash;the
way behind us is blocked with solid building
which cannot be removed. And in this great onward
order, life turns not back to death, but goes forward
to other life, which we may call immortality. If I
would turn backward, I stand still in paralyzed opposition
to the mighty sweep of heavenly law. It must go
on, and if I could resist and refuse to go with it, I
should die a moral death, having isolated myself from
the movement which is life. But, do what I will, I
cannot resist it. I am carried on perforce, as inanimate
rocks and trees are swept away in the course of a
resistless torrent. Shall I then abdicate my human
privilege which makes the forces of nature Angels to
help and minister to me? Let me, instead, take hold
of the guiding cords of life with resolute hands and
press onward, following the illustrious army whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385b" id="Page_385b">[385]</a></span>
crowned chiefs have gone before. They too had their
weakness, their sorrow, their sin. But they are set
as stars in the firmament of God, and their torches
flash heavenly light upon our doubtful way, ay, even
upon the mysterious bridge whose toll is silence. Beyond
that silence reigns the perfect harmony."</p>

<p>"<i>November 6.</i> Expecting to leave this dear place
to-morrow before noon, I write one last record in this
diary to say that I am very thankful for the season
just at end, which has been busy and yet restful. I
have seen old friends and new ones, all with pleasure,
and mostly with profit of a social and spiritual kind.
I have seen dear little Eleanor Hall, the sweetest of
babies. Have had all of my dear children with me,
some of my grandchildren, and four of my great-grands.</p>

<p>"Our Papéterie has had pleasant meetings.... I am
full of hope for the winter. Have had a long season
of fresh air, delightful and very invigorating....
<i>Utinam! Gott in Himmel sei Dank!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>November 28. Boston.</i> Have been much troubled
of late by uncertainties about life beyond the present.
Quite suddenly, very recently, it occurred to me to consider
that Christ understood that spiritual life would
not end with death, and that His expressed certainty
as to the future life was founded upon His discernment
of spiritual things. So, in so far as I am a Christian,
I must believe in the immortality of the soul, as our
Master surely did. I cannot understand why I have
not thought of that before. I think now that I shall
nevermore lose sight of it.... Had a very fine call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386b" id="Page_386b">[386]</a></span>
from Mr. Locke, author of the 'Beloved Vagabond,'
a book which I have enjoyed."</p>

<p>"<i>December 5....</i> I learned to-day that my dear
friend of many years [the Reverend Mary H. Graves]
passed away last night very peacefully.... This is
a heart sorrow for me. She has been a most faithful,
affectionate and helpful friend. I scarcely know
whether any one, outside of my family, would have
pained me more by their departure...."</p>

<p>This was indeed a loss. "Saint Mouse," as we
called her, was a familiar friend of the household:
a little gray figure, with the face of a plain angel.
For many years she had been the only person who was
allowed to touch our mother's papers. She often came
for a day or two and straightened out the tangle. She
was the only approach to a secretary ever tolerated.</p>

<p>We used to grieve because our mother had no first-rate
"Crutch"; it seemed a waste of power. Now,
we see that it was partly the instinct of self-preservation,&mdash;keeping
the "doing" muscles tense and strong,
because action was vital and necessary to her&mdash;partly
the still deeper instinct of giving her <i>self</i>, body
and mind. She seldom failed in any important thing
she undertook; the "chores" of life she often left for
others to attend to or neglect.</p>

<p>The Christmas services, the Christmas oratorio,
brought her the usual serene joy and comfort. She
insists that Handel wrote parts of the "Messiah" in
heaven itself. "Where else could he have got 'Comfort
ye,' 'Thy rebuke,' 'Thou shalt break them,' and
much besides?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387b" id="Page_387b">[387]</a></span>Late in December, 1908, came the horror of the
Sicilian earthquake. She felt at first that it was impossible
to reconcile omnipotence and perfect benevolence
with this catastrophe.</p>

<p>"We must hold judgment in suspense and say, 'We
don't and we can't understand.'"</p>

<p>She had several tasks on hand this winter, among
them a poem for the Centenary of Lincoln's birth.
On February 7 she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After a time of despair about the poem for the
Lincoln Centenary some lines came to me in the early
morning. I arose, wrapped myself warmly, and wrote
what I could, making quite a beginning."</p>

<p>She finished the poem next day, and on the 12th
she went "with three handsome grandchildren" to deliver
it at Symphony Hall before the Grand Army of
the Republic and their friends.</p>

<p>"The police had to make an entrance for us. I was
presently conducted to my seat on the platform. The
hall was crammed to its utmost capacity. I had felt
doubts of the power of my voice to reach so large a
company, but strength seemed to be given to me at
once, and I believe that I was heard very well. T. W.
H. [Colonel Higginson] came to me soon after my
reading and said, 'You have been a good girl and
behaved yourself well.'"</p>

<p>The next task was an essay on "Immortality,"
which cost her much labor and anxious thought.</p>

<p>"<i>March 3....</i> Got at last some solid ground for
my screed on 'Immortality.' Our experience of the
goodness of God in our daily life assures us of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388b" id="Page_388b">[388]</a></span>
mercy hereafter, and seeing God everywhere, we shall
dwell in the house of the Lord forever."</p>

<p>"<i>March 27.</i> I am succeeding better with my 'Immortality'
paper. Had to-day a little bit of visioning
with which I think that I would willingly depart, when
my time comes. The dreadful fear of being buried
alive disappeared for a time, and I saw only the goodness
of God, to which it seemed that I could trust all
question of the future life. I said to myself&mdash;'The
best will be for thee and me.'"</p>

<p>It was in this mood that she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I, for one, feel that my indebtedness grows with
my years. And it occurred to me the other day that
when I should depart from this earthly scene, 'God's
poor Debtor' might be the fittest inscription for my
gravestone, if I should have one. So much have I received
from the great Giver, so little have I been able
to return."</p>

<p>"<i>April 5....</i> Heard May Alden Ward, N.E.W.C.,
on 'Current Events.' <i>Praecipuë</i> tariff reform. Proposed
a small group to study the question from the
point of view of the consumer. What to protect and
how? American goods cheaper in Europe than here.
Blank tells me of pencils made here for a foreign market
and sold in Germany and England at a price impossible
here. I said that the real bottomless pit is the depth
of infamous slander with which people will assail our
public servants, especially when they are faithful and
incorruptible, apropos of aspersions cast on Roosevelt
and Taft. Mrs. Ward read a very violent attack upon
some public man of a hundred or more years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389b" id="Page_389b">[389]</a></span>
He was quoted as a monster of tyranny and injustice.
His name was George Washington."</p>

<p>"<i>April 8....</i> My prayer for this Easter is that I
may not waste the inspiration of spring...."</p>

<p>In these days came another real sorrow to her.</p>

<p>"<i>April 10.</i> To-day brings the sad news of Marion
Crawford's death at Sorrento. His departure seems to
have been a peaceful one. He comforted his family
and had his daughter Eleanor read Plato's 'Dialogues'
to him. Was unconscious at the last. Poor dear Marion!
The end, in his case, comes early. His father was,
I think, in the early forties when he died of a cancer
behind the eye which caused blindness. He, Thomas
Crawford, had a long and very distressing illness."</p>

<p>Crawford had been very dear to her, ever since the
days when, a radiant schoolboy, he came and went in
his vacations. There was a complete sympathy and
understanding between them, and there were few
people whom she enjoyed more.</p>

<p>"I wrote a letter to be read, if approved, to-morrow
evening at the Faneuil Hall meeting held to advocate
the revision of our extradition treaty with the Russian
Government, which at present seems to allow
that government too much latitude of incrimination,
whereby political and civil offences can too easily
be confused and a revolutionist surrendered as a
criminal, which he may or may not be."</p>

<p>Later in the month she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the early morning I began to feel that I must
attempt some sort of tribute to my dear friend of
many years, Dr. Holmes, the centenary of whose birth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390b" id="Page_390b">[390]</a></span>
is to be celebrated on Tuesday next. I stayed at home
from church to follow some random rhymes which
came to me in connection with my remembrance of my
ever affectionate friend. I love to think of his beautiful
service to his age and to future ages. I fear that
my rhymes will fail to crystallize, but sometimes a
bad beginning leads to something better...."</p>

<p>The poem was finished, more or less to her satisfaction,
but she was weary with working over it, and
with "reading heavy books, Max Müller on metaphysics,
Blanqui on political economy."</p>

<p>"<i>May 10.</i> I began this day the screed of 'Values'
which I mentioned the other day. I have great hopes
of accomplishing something useful, remembering, as
I do, with sore indignation, my own mistakes, and
desiring to help young people to avoid similar ones."</p>

<p>The ninetieth birthday was a festival, indeed. Letters
and telegrams poured in, rose in toppling piles
which almost&mdash;not quite&mdash;daunted her; she would
hear every one, would answer as many as flesh and
blood could compass. Here is one of them:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p><br />Most hearty congratulations on your ninetieth birthday
from the boy you picked up somewhere in New
York and placed in the New York Orphan Asylum on
April 6th, 1841. Sorry I have never been able to meet
you in all that time. You [were] one of the Board of
Trustees at that time.</p>

<p>I was then about five years old, now seventy-three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391b" id="Page_391b">[391]</a></span>Writing to her friend of many years, Mrs. Ellen
Mitchell, she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your birthday letter was and is much valued by
me. Its tone of earnest affection is an element in the
new inspiration recently given me by such a wonderful
testimony of public and private esteem and goodwill
as has been granted me in connection with my attainment
of ninety years. It all points to the future. I
must work to deserve what I have received. My
dearest wish would be to take up some thread of our
A.A.W. work, and continue it. I rather hope that I
may find the way to do this in the study of Economics
which I am just starting with a small group...."</p>


<p class="center"><i>To Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford</i></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Spofford</span>,&mdash;
</p>

<p>You wrote me a lovely letter on my ninetieth birthday.
I cannot help feeling as if the impression expressed
by you and so many other kind friends of my
personal merits must refer to some good work which I
have yet to do. What I have done looks small to me,
but I have tried a good deal for the best I have known.
This is all I can say. I am much touched by your letter,
and encouraged to go on trying. Don't you think
that the best things are already in view? The opportunities
for women, the growing toleration and sympathy
in religion, the sacred cause of peace? I have
lived, like Moses, to see the entrance into the Promised
Land. How much is this to be thankful for! My
crabbed hand shows how Time abridges my working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392b" id="Page_392b">[392]</a></span>
powers, but I march to the brave music still, as you
and many of the juniors do.</p>

</div></blockquote>


<p><br />Close upon the Birthday came another occasion of
the kind which we&mdash;in these later years&mdash;at once
welcomed and deplored. She enjoyed nothing so much
as a "function," and nothing tired her so much.</p>

<p>On June 16, Brown University, her husband's <i>alma
mater</i> and her grandfather's, conferred upon her the
degree of Doctor of Laws. She went to Providence
to receive it in person, and thus describes the commencement
exercises to Mrs. Mitchell:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The ordeal of the Doctorate was rather trying, but
was made as easy as possible for me. The venerable
old church was well filled, and was quite beautiful.
I sat in one of the front pews&mdash;two learned people
led me to the foot of the platform from which President
Faunce, with some laudatory remarks, handed me my
diploma, while some third party placed a picturesque
hood upon my shoulders. The band played the air
of my 'Battle Hymn,' and applause followed me as I
went back to my seat. So there!"</p>

<p>Her companion on that occasion writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She sat listening quietly to the addresses, watched
each girl and boy just starting on the voyage of life as
they marched to the platform and received from the
President's hand the scrap of paper, the parchment
diploma, reward of all their studies. Her name was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393b" id="Page_393b">[393]</a></span>
called last. With the deliberate step of age, she walked
forward, wearing her son's college gown over her white
dress, his mortar-board cap over her lace veil. She
seemed less moved than any person present; she
could not see what we saw, the tiny gallant figure bent
with fourscore and ten years of study and hard labor.
As she moved between the girl students who stood up
to let her pass, she whispered, 'How tall they are! It
seems to me the girls are much taller than they used
to be.' Did she realize how much shorter she was than
she once had been? I think not.</p>

<p>"Then, her eyes sparkling with fun while all other
eyes were wet, she shook her hard-earned diploma
with a gay gesture in the faces of those girls, cast on
them a keen glance that somehow was a challenge,
'Catch up with me if you can!'</p>

<p>"She had labored long for the higher education of
women, suffered estrangement, borne ridicule for it&mdash;the
sight of those girl graduates, starting on their life
voyage equipped with a good education, was like a
sudden realization of a life-long dream; uplifted her,
gave her strength for the fatigues of the day. At the
dinner given for her and the college dignitaries by
Mrs. William Goddard, she was at her best."</p>

<p>She was asked for a Fourth of July message to the
Sunday-School children of the Congregational Church,
and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want them to build up character in themselves
and in the community, to give to the country just so
many men and women who will be incapable of meanness
or dishonesty, who will look upon life as a sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394b" id="Page_394b">[394]</a></span>
trust, given to them for honorable service to their
fellow men and women. I would have them feel that,
whether rich or poor, they are bound to be of use in
their day and generation, and to be mindful of the
Scripture saying that 'no man liveth unto himself.'
We all have our part to do in keeping up the character
and credit of our country. For her sake we should
study to become good and useful citizens."</p>


<p><br />In the summer of 1909 the Cretan question came up
again. Once more Turkey attempted to regain active
possession of Crete; once more the voice of Christendom
was raised in protest. She had no thought this
time of being "too old." Being called upon for help,
she wrote at once to President Taft, "praying him to
find some way to help the Cretans in the terrible prospect
of their being delivered over, bound hand and
foot, to Turkish misrule." She was soon gladdened by
a reply from the President, saying that he had not
considered the Cretans as he should, but promising to
send her letter to the Secretary of State. "I thank God
most earnestly," she writes, "for even thus much.
To-day, I feel that I must write all pressing letters,
as my time may be short."</p>

<p>Accordingly she composed an open letter on the
Cretan question. "It is rather crude, but it is from
my heart of hearts. I had to write it."</p>

<p>Suffrage, too, had its share of her attention this
summer. There were meetings at "Marble House"
[Newport] in which she was deeply interested. She attended
one in person; to the next she sent the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395b" id="Page_395b">[395]</a></span>
and third generations, staying at home herself to amuse
and care for the fourth.</p>

<p>On the last day of August she records once more
her sorrow at the departure of the summer. She adds,
"God grant me to be prepared to live or die, as He
shall decree. It is best, I think, to anticipate life, and
to cultivate forethought.... I think it may have been
to-day that I read the last pages of Martineau's 'Seat
of Authority in Religion,' an extremely valuable book,
yet a painful one to read, so entirely does it do away
with the old-time divinity of the dear Christ. But it
leaves Him the divinity of character&mdash;no theory or
discovery can take that away."</p>

<p>Late September brought an occasion to which she
had looked forward with mingled pleasure and dread;
the celebration of the Hudson-Fulton Centennial in
New York. She had been asked for a poem, and had
taken great pains with it, writing and re-writing it,
hammering and polishing. She thought it finished in
July, yet two days before the celebration she was still
re-touching it.</p>

<p>"I have been much dissatisfied with my Fulton
poem. Lying down to rest this afternoon, instead of
sleep, of which I felt no need, I began to try for some
new lines which should waken it up a little, and think
that I succeeded. I had brought no manuscript paper,
so had to scrawl my amendments on Sanborn's old long
envelope."</p>

<p>Later in the day two more lines came to her, and
again two the day after. Finally, on the morning of the
day itself, on awakening, she cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396b" id="Page_396b">[396]</a></span>"I have got my last verse!"</p>

<p>The occasion was a notable one. The stage of the
Metropolitan Opera House was filled with dignitaries,
delegates from other States, foreign diplomats in
brilliant uniforms. The only woman among them was
the little figure in white, to greet whom, as she came
forward on her son's arm, the whole great assembly
rose and stood. They remained standing while she
read her poem in clear unfaltering tones; the applause
that rang out showed that she had once more touched
the heart of the public.</p>

<p>This poem was printed in "Collier's Weekly," unfortunately
from a copy made before the "last verse"
was finished to her mind. This distressed her. "Let
this be a lesson!" she said. "Never print a poem or
speech till it has been delivered; always give the
eleventh hour its chance!"</p>

<p>This eleventh hour brought a very special chance;
a few days before, the world had been electrified by
the news of Peary's discovery of the North Pole: it
was the general voice that cried through her lips,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
The Flag of Freedom crowns the Pole!<br />
</p>

<p>The following letter was written while she was at
work on the poem:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>To Laura</i></p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

<p>Why, yes, I'm doing the best I know how. Have
written a poem for the Hudson and Fulton celebration,
September 28. Worked hard at it. Guess it's only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397b" id="Page_397b">[397]</a></span>
pretty good, if even that. Maud takes me out every
day under the pine tree, makes me sit while she reads
aloud Freeman's shorter work on Sicily. I enjoy this....
I have just read Froude's "Cæsar," which Sanborn
says he hates, but which I found as readable as
a novel. Am also reading a work of Kuno Fischer on
"Philosophy," especially relating to Descartes. Now
you know, Miss, or should know, that <i>same</i> had great
<i>fame</i>, and sometimes <i>blame</i>, as a philosopher. But
he don't make no impression on my mind. I never
doubted that I was, so don't need no "<i>cogito, ergo
sum,</i>" which is what Carty, old Boy, amounts to. Your
letter, dear, was a very proper attention under the
circumstances. Shouldn't object to another. Lemme
see! objects cannot be subjects, nor <i>vice versa</i>. How do
you know that you washed your face this morning?
You don't know it, and I don't believe that you did.
You might consult H. Richards about some of these
particulars. He is a man of some sense. You are, bless
you, not much wiser than your affectionate</p>

<p>Returned to Oak Glen, after the celebration, she
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>I got through all right, in spite of prospective views,
of fainting fits, apoplexy, what not? Trouble is now
that I cannot keep calling up some thousands of people,
and saying: "Admire me, do. I wrote it all my little
own self." Seriously, there is a little reaction from so
much excitement. But I hope to recover my senses in
time. I improved the last two stanzas much when I
recited the poem. The last line read</p>

<p class="center">

</p>

<p>I tell you, I brought it out with a will, and they all
[the audience] made a great noise....</p></blockquote>


<p><br />We doubt if any of the compliments pleased her so
much as that of the Irish charwoman who, mop in
hand, had been listening at one of the side doors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399b" id="Page_399b">[399]</a></span>
the theatre. "Oh, you dear little old lady!" she cried.
"You speaked your piece <i>real</i> good!"</p>

<p>Late October finds her preparing for the move to
Boston.</p>

<p>"I have had what I may call a spasm of gratitude
to God for His great goodness to me, sitting in my
pleasant little parlor, with the lovely golden trees in
near view, and the devotion of my children and great
kindness of my friends well in mind. Oh! help me,
divine Father, to merit even a very little of Thy kindness!"</p>

<p>In this autumn she was elected a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Letters, and in December
she wrote for its first meeting a poem called
"The Capitol." She greatly desired to read this poem
before the association, and Maud, albeit with many
misgivings, agreed to take her on to Washington.
This was not to be. On learning of her intention, three
officers of the association, William Dean Howells,
Robert Underwood Johnson, and Thomas Nelson
Page, sent her a "round-robin" telegram, begging her
not to run the risk of the long winter journey. The
kindly suggestion was not altogether well taken.
"Ha!" she flashed out. "They think I am too old,
but there's a little ginger left in the old blue jar!"</p>

<p>She soon realized the wisdom as well as the friendliness
of the round robin, and confided to the Journal
that she had been in two minds about it.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks to God who gave us the blessed Christ.
What a birth was this! Two thousand years have only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400b" id="Page_400b">[400]</a></span>
increased our gratitude for it. How it has consecrated
Babyhood and Maternity! Two infants, grown to
man's estate, govern the civilized world to-day, Christ
and Moses. I am still thankful to be here in the flesh,
as they were once, and oh! that I may never pass
where they are not!"</p>

<p>The winter of 1909-10 was a severe one, and she
was more or less housed; yet the days were full and
bright for her. "Life," she cried one day, "is like a
cup of tea; all the sugar is at the bottom!" and again,
"Oh! I must go so soon, and I am only just ready to
go to college!"</p>

<p>When it was too cold for her to go out, she took her
walk in the house, with the windows open, pacing
resolutely up and down her room and the room opposite.
She sat long hours at her desk, in patient toil.
She was always picking up dropped stitches, trying to
keep every promise, answer every note.</p>

<p>"Went through waste-paper basket, redeeming some
bits torn to fragments, which either should be answered
or recorded. Wrote an autograph for Mr. Blank. It
was asked for in 1905. Had been <i>put away</i> and forgotten."</p>

<p>She got too tired that morning, and could not fully
enjoy the Authors' Club in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Colonel Higginson and I sat like two superannuated
old idols. Each of us said a little say when the
business was finished."</p>

<p>It is not recalled that they presented any such
appearance to others.</p>

<p>She went to the opera, a mingled pleasure and pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401b" id="Page_401b">[401]</a></span>"It was the 'Huguenots,' much of which was known
to me in early youth, when I used to sing the 'Rataplan'
chorus with my brothers. I sang also Valentine's
prayer, '<i>Parmi les fleurs mon rêve se ranime</i>,' with obligato
bassoon accompaniment, using the 'cello instead.
I know that I sang much better that night than usual,
for dear Uncle John said to me, 'You singed good!'
Poor Huti played the 'cello. Now, I listened for the familiar
bits, and recognized the drinking chorus in Act
1st, the 'Rataplan' in Act 2d. Valentine's prayer, if
given, was so overlaid with <i>fioritura</i> that I did not feel
sure of it. The page's pretty song was all right, but I
suffered great fatigue, and the reminiscences were sad."</p>

<p>Through the winter she continued the study of
economics with some fifteen members of the New
England Woman's Club. She read Bergson too, and
now and then "got completely bogged" in him, finding
no "central point that led anywhere."</p>

<p>About this time she wrote:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><i>"Some Rules for Everyday Life</i></p>

<p>"1. Begin every day with a few minutes of retired
meditation, tending to prayer, in order to feel within
yourself the spiritual power which will enable you to
answer the demands of practical life.</p>

<p>"2. Cultivate systematic employment and learn to
estimate correctly the time required to accomplish
whatever you may undertake.</p>

<p>"3. Try to occupy both your mind and your
muscles, since each of these will help the other, and
both deteriorate without sufficient exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402b" id="Page_402b">[402]</a></span>"4. Remember that there is great inherent selfishness
in human nature, and train yourself to consider
adequately the advantage and pleasure of others.</p>

<p>"5. Be thankful to be useful.</p>

<p>"6. Try to ascertain what are real uses, and to follow
such maxims and methods as will stand the test
of time, and not fail with the passing away of a transient
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"7. Be neither over distant nor over familiar in
your intercourse; friendly rather than confidential;
not courting responsibility, but not declining it when
it of right belongs to you.</p>

<p>"8. Be careful not to falsify true principles by a
thoughtless and insufficient application of them.</p>

<p>"9. Though actions of high morality ensure in the
end the greatest success, yet view them in the light of
obligation, not in that of policy.</p>

<p>"10. Whatever your talents may be, consider yourself
as belonging to the average of humanity, since,
even if superior to many in some respects, you will be
likely to fall below them in others.</p>

<p>"11. Remember the Christian triad of virtues.
Have faith in principles, hope in God, charity with and
for all mankind."</p>


<p><br />A windy March found her "rather miserably ailing."
Dr. Langmaid came, and pronounced her
lungs "sound as a bass drum"; nothing amiss save
a throat irritated by wind and dust. Thereupon she
girded herself and buckled to her next task, a poem
for the centenary of James Freeman Clarke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403b" id="Page_403b">[403]</a></span>"I have despaired of a poem which people seem to
expect from me for the dear James Freeman's centennial.
To-day the rhymes suddenly flowed, but the
thought is difficult to convey&mdash;the reflection of heaven
in his soul is what he gave, and what he left us."</p>

<p>"<i>April 1.</i> Very much tossed up and down about my
poem...."</p>

<p>"<i>April 2.</i> Was able at last, <i>D.G.</i>, to make the poem
explain itself. Rosalind, my incorruptible critic, was
satisfied with it. I think and hope that all my trouble
has been worth while. I bestowed it most unwillingly,
having had little hope that I could make my figure of
speech intelligible. I am very thankful for this poem,
cannot be thankful enough."</p>

<p>This was her third tribute to the beloved Minister,
and is, perhaps, the best of the three. The thought
which she found so difficult of conveyance is thus
expressed:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Lifting from the Past its veil,<br />
What of his does now avail?<br />
Just a mirror in his breast<br />
That revealed a heavenly guest,<br />
And the love that made us free<br />
Of the same high company.<br />
These he brought us, these he left,<br />
When we were of him bereft.<br /><br />
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
*  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; *
</p>


<p><br />She thus describes the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Coughed in the night, and at waking suffered much
in mind, fearing that a wild fit of coughing might make
my reading unacceptable and even ridiculous. Imagine
my joy when I found my voice clear and strong, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404b" id="Page_404b">[404]</a></span>
read the whole poem [forty-four lines] without the
slightest inclination to cough. This really was the
granting of my prayer, and my first thought about it
was, 'What shall I render to the Lord for all His goodness
to me?' I thought, 'I will interest myself more
efficiently in the great questions which concern Life
and Society at large.' If I have 'the word for the
moment,' as some think, I will take more pains to
speak it."</p>

<p>A little later came a centenary which&mdash;alas!&mdash;she
did not enjoy. It was that of Margaret Fuller, and
was held in Cambridge. She was asked to attend it,
and was assured that she "would not be expected to
speak." This kindly wish to spare fatigue to a woman
of ninety-one was the last thing she desired. She
could hardly believe that she would be left out&mdash;she,
who had known Margaret, had talked and corresponded
with her.</p>

<p>"They have not asked me to speak!" she said more
than once as the time drew near.</p>

<p>She was reassured; of course they would ask her
when they saw her!</p>

<p>"I have a poem on Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Take it with you! Of course you will be asked to
say something, and then you will be all ready with
your poem in your pocket."</p>

<p>Thus Maud, in all confidence. Indeed, if one of her
own had gone with her, the matter would have been
easily arranged; unfortunately, the companion was a
friend who could make no motion in the matter. She
returned tired and depressed. "They did not ask me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405b" id="Page_405b">[405]</a></span>
to speak," she said, "and I was the only person present
who had known Margaret and remembered her."</p>

<p>For a little while this incident weighed on her. She
felt that she was "out of the running"; but a winning
race was close at hand.</p>

<p>The question of pure milk was before the Massachusetts
Legislature, and was being hotly argued. An
urgent message came by telephone; would Mrs. Howe
say a word for the good cause? Maud went to her
room, and found her at her desk, the morning's campaign
already begun.</p>

<p>"There is to be a hearing at the State House on the
milk question; they want you dreadfully to speak.
What do you say?"</p>

<p>"Give me half an hour!" she said.</p>

<p>Before the half-hour was over she had sketched out
her speech and dressed herself in her best flowered
silk cloak and her new lilac hood, a birthday gift from
a poor seamstress. Arrived at the State House, she
sat patiently through many speeches. Finally she was
called on to speak; it was noticed that no oath was
required of her. As she rose and came forward on
her daughter's arm,&mdash;"You may remain seated, Mrs.
Howe," said the benevolent chairman.</p>

<p>"I prefer to stand!" was the reply.</p>

<p>She had left her notes behind; she did not need them.
Standing in the place where, year after year, she had
stood to ask for the full rights of citizenship, she made
her last thrilling appeal for justice.</p>

<p>"We have heard," she said, "a great deal about the
farmers' and the dealers' side of this case. We want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406b" id="Page_406b">[406]</a></span>
the matter settled on the ground of justice and mercy;
it ought not to take long to settle what is just to all
parties. Justice to all! Let us stand on that. There
is one deeply interested party, however, of whom we
have heard nothing. He cannot speak for himself; I
am here to speak for him: the infant!"</p>

<p>The effect was electrical. In an instant the tired audience,
the dull or dogged or angry debaters, woke to
a new interest, a new spirit. No farmer so rough, no
middle-man so keen, no legislator so apathetic, but
felt the thrill. In a silence charged with deepest feeling
all listened as to a prophetess, as, step by step, she
unfolded the case of the infant as against farmers and
dealers.</p>

<p>As Arthur Dehon Hill, counsel for the Pure Milk
Association, led her from the room, he said, "Mrs.
Howe, you have saved the day!"</p>

<p>This incident was still in her mind on her ninety-first
birthday, a few days later.</p>

<p>"My parlors are full of beautiful flowers and other
gifts, interpreted by notes expressive of much affection,
and telegrams of the same sort. What dare I ask
for more? Only that I may do something in the future
to deserve all this love and gratitude. I have intended
to deserve it all and more. Yet, when in thought I
review my life, I feel the waste and loss of power thro'
want of outlook. Like many another young person,
I did not know what my really available gifts were.
Perhaps the best was a feeling of what I may call 'the
sense of the moment,' which led a French friend to say
of me: '<i>Mme. Howe possède le mot à un dégré remarquable.</i>'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407b" id="Page_407b">[407]</a></span>
I was often praised for saying 'just the right
word,' and I usually did this with a strong feeling that
it ought to be said."</p>

<p>Early in June, just as she was preparing for the
summer flitting, she had a bad fall, breaking a rib.
This delayed the move for a week, no more, the bone
knitting easily. She was soon happy among her green
trees, her birds singing around her.</p>

<p>The memories of this last summer come flocking in,
themselves like bright birds. She was so well, so joyous,
giving her lilies with such full hands; it was a
golden time.</p>

<p>As the body failed, the mind&mdash;or so it seemed to
us&mdash;grew ever clearer, the veil that shrouds the spirit
ever more transparent. She "saw things hidden."</p>

<p>One day a summer neighbor came, bringing her son,
a handsome, athletic fellow, smartly dressed, a fine
figure of gilded youth. She looked at him a good deal:
presently she said suddenly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You write poetry!"</p>

<p>The lad turned crimson: his mother looked dumfounded.
It proved that he had lately written a prize
poem, and that literature was the goal of his ambition.
Another day she found a philosopher hidden in
what seemed to the rest of the family merely "a
callow boy in pretty white duck clothes." So she
plucked out the heart of each man's mystery, but so
tenderly that it was yielded gladly, young and old
alike feeling themselves understood.</p>

<p>Among the visitors of this summer none was more
welcome than her great-grandson, Christopher Birckhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408b" id="Page_408b">[408]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
then an infant in arms. She loved to hold and
watch the child, brooding over him with grave tenderness:
it was a beautiful and gracious picture of
Past and Future.</p>

<p>Maud had just written a book on Sicily, and, as
always, our mother read and corrected the galley
proofs. She did this with exquisite care and thoughtfulness,
never making her suggestions on the proof itself,
but on a separate sheet of paper, with the number of
the galley, the phrase, and her suggested emendations.
This was her invariable custom: the writer must be perfectly
free to retain her own phrase, if she preferred it.</p>

<p>Walking tired her that summer, but she was very
faithful about it.</p>

<p>"Zacko," she would command John Elliott, "take
me for a walk."</p>

<p>The day before she took to her bed, he remembers
that she clung to him more than usual and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It tires me very much." (This after walking twice
round the piazza.)</p>

<p>"Once more!" he encouraged.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I have walked all I can to-day."</p>

<p>"Let me take you back to your room this way," he
said, leading her back by the piazza. "That makes
five times each way!"</p>

<p>She laughed and was pleased to have done this, but
he thinks she had a great sense of weakness too.</p>

<p>Her favorite piece on the "Victor" that summer was
"The Artillerist's Oath." The music had a gallant
ring to it, and there was something heroic about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409b" id="Page_409b">[409]</a></span>
whole thing, something that suggested the Forlorn
Hope&mdash;how many of them she had led! When nine
o'clock came, she would ask for this piece by the
nickname she had given it, taken from one of its odd
lines,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"I'll wed thee in the battle's front!"<br />
</p>

<p>While the song was being given, she was all alert
and alive, even if she may have been sleepy earlier in
the evening. She would get up with a little gesture of
courage, and take leave of us, always with a certain
ceremony, that was like the withdrawing of royalty.
The evening was then over, and we too went to bed!</p>

<p>As we gather up our treasures of this last summer,
we remember that several things might have prepared
us for what was coming, had not our eyes been holden.
She spoke a great deal of old times, the figures of her
childhood and girlhood being evidently very near to
her. She quoted them often; "My grandma used to
say&mdash;" She spoke as naturally as the boy in the
next room might speak of her.</p>

<p>She would not look in the glass; "I don't like to
see my old face!" she said. She could not see the
beauty that every one else saw. Yet she kept to the
very last a certain tender coquetry. She loved her
white dresses, and the flowered silk cloak of that last
summer. She chose with care the jewels suited to
each costume, the topaz cross for the white, the amethysts
for the lilac. She had a great dread of old people's
being untidy or unprepossessing in appearance,
and never grudged the moments spent in adjusting
the right cap and lace collar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410b" id="Page_410b">[410]</a></span>There was an almost unearthly light in her face, a
transparency and sweetness that spoke to others more
plainly than to us: Hugh Birckhead saw and recognized
it as a look he had seen in other faces of saintly age,
as their translation approached. But we said joyously
to her and to each other, "She will round out
the century; we shall all keep the Hundredth Birthday
together!" And we and she partly believed it.</p>

<p>The doctor had insisted strongly that she should
keep, through the summer at least, the trained nurse
who had ministered to her after her fall. She "heard
what he said, but it made no difference." In early
August she records "a passage at arms with Maud, in
which I clearly announced my intention of dispensing
with the services of a trained nurse, my good health
and simple habits rendering it entirely unnecessary."</p>

<p>She threatened to write to her man of business.</p>

<p>"<i>I would rather die</i>," she said, "than be an old
woman with a nurse!"</p>

<p>Maud and Florence wept, argued, implored, but
the nurse was dismissed. The Journal acknowledges
that "her ministrations and Dr. Cobb's diagnosis
have been very beneficial to my bodily health." On
the same day she records the visit of a Persian Prince,
who had come to this country chiefly to see two persons,
the President of the United States and Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe. "He also claims to be a reincarnation
of some remarkable philosopher; and to be so
greatly interested in the cause of Peace that he declines
to visit our ships now in the harbor here, to
which he has been invited."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411b" id="Page_411b">[411]</a></span>Reading Theodore Parker's sermon on "Wisdom
and Intellect," she found it so full of notable sayings
that she thought "a little familiar book of daily
inspiration and aspiration" might be made from his
writings: she wrote to Mr. Francis J. Garrison suggesting
this, and suggesting also, what had been
long in her mind, the collecting and publishing of her
"Occasional Poems."</p>

<p>In late September, she was "moved to write one or
more open letters on what religion really is, for some
one of the women's papers"; and the next day began
upon "What is Religion?" or rather, "What Sort of
Religion makes Religious Liberty possible?"</p>

<p>A day or two later, she was giving an "offhand talk"
on the early recollections of Newport at the Papéterie,
and going to an afternoon tea at a musical house,
where, after listening to Schumann Romances and
Chopin waltzes, and to the "Battle Hymn" on the
'cello, she was moved to give a performance of "Flibbertigibbet."
This occasion reminded her happily of
her father's house, of Henry "playing tolerably on the
'cello, Marion studying the violin, Bro' Sam's lovely
tenor voice."</p>

<p>Now came the early October days when she was
to receive the degree of Doctor of Laws from Smith
College. She hesitated about making the tiresome
journey, but finally, "Grudging the trouble and expense,
I decide to go to Smith College, for my degree,
but think I won't do so any more."</p>

<p>She started accordingly with daughter and maid,
for Northampton, Massachusetts. It was golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412b" id="Page_412b">[412]</a></span>
weather, and she was in high spirits. Various college
dignitaries met her at the station; one of these had
given up a suite of rooms for her use; she was soon
established in much peace and comfort.</p>

<p>Wednesday, October 5, was a day of perfect autumn
beauty. She was early dressed in her white dress, with
the college gown of rich black silk over it, the "mortar-board"
covering in like manner her white lace cap.
Thus arrayed, a wheeled chair conveyed her to the
great hall, already packed with visitors and graduates,
as was the deep platform with college officials and
guests of honor. Opposite the platform, as if hung in
air, a curving gallery was filled with white-clad girls,
some two thousand of them; as she entered they rose
like a flock of doves, and with them the whole audience.
They rose once more when her name was called, last
in the list of those honored with degrees; and as she
came forward, the organ pealed, and the great chorus
of fresh young voices broke out with</p>

<p>
"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>It was the last time.</p>

<p>Later in the day the students of Chapin House
brought their guest-book, begging for her autograph.
She looked at Laura with a twinkle.</p>

<p>"Do you think they would like me to write something?"</p>

<p>Assured on that point, she waited a moment, and
then wrote after her signature,&mdash;</p>

<p>
Wandered to Smith College<br />
In pursuit of knowledge;<br />
Leaves so much the wiser,<br />
Nothing can surprise her!<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413b" id="Page_413b">[413]</a></span>She reached home apparently without undue fatigue.
"She will be more tired to-morrow!" we said;
but she was not. Her son came for the week-end, and
his presence was always a cordial. Sunday was a
happy day. In the evening we gathered round the
piano, she playing, son and daughters singing the old
German student songs brought by "Uncle Sam" from
Heidelberg seventy years before.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday she went to the Papéterie, and was
the life and soul of the party, sparkling with merriment.
Driving home, it was so warm that she begged
to have the top of the carriage put back, and so she
enjoyed the crowning pageant of the autumn, the full
hunter's moon and the crimson ball of the sun both
visible at once.</p>

<p>Wednesday found her busy at her desk, confessing
to a slight cold, but making nothing of it. The next
day bronchitis developed, followed by pneumonia.
For several days the issue seemed doubtful, the strong
constitution fighting for life. Two devoted physicians
were beside her, one the friend of many years, the
other a young assistant. The presence of the latter
puzzled her, but his youth and strength seemed tonic
to her, and she would rest quietly with her hand in his
strong hand.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening the younger physician thought
her convalescent; the elder said, "If she pulls through
the next twenty-four hours, she will recover."</p>

<p>But she was too weary. That night they heard her
say, "God will help me!" and again, toward morning,
"I am so tired!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414b" id="Page_414b">[414]</a></span>Being alone for a moment with Maud, she spoke
one word: a little word that had meant "good-bye"
between them in the nursery days.</p>

<p>So, in the morning of Monday, October 17, her
spirit passed quietly on to God's keeping.</p>

<p>Those who were present at her funeral will not forget
it. The flower-decked church, the mourning multitude,
the white coffin borne high on the shoulders of
eight stalwart grandsons, the words of age-long wisdom
and beauty gathered into a parting tribute, the bugle
sounding Taps, as she passed out in her last earthly
triumph, the blind children singing round the grave
on which the autumn sun shone with a final golden
greeting.</p>


<p><br />We have told the story of our mother's life, possibly
at too great length; but she herself told it in eight
words.</p>

<p>"Tell me," Maud asked her once, "what is the ideal
aim of life?"</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and replied, dwelling thoughtfully
on each word,&mdash;</p>

<p>"To learn, to teach, to serve, to enjoy!"</p>

his picturesqueness never.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> We have not found the date of his death, but Horry gives the principal
features of his will as he got them from the family. He calls Judith
Marion "Louisa," but that is his picturesque way. She may have been
"Judith Louisa"! Women's names were not of much consequence in those
days.
</p><p>
"After having, in the good old way, bequeathed 'his soul to God who
gave it,' and 'his body to the earth out of which it was taken,' he proceeds:&mdash;
</p><p>
"'In the first place, as to debts, thank God, I owe none, and therefore
shall give my executors but little trouble on that score.
</p><p>
"'Secondly,&mdash;As to the poor, I have always treated them as my brethren.
My dear family will, I know, follow my example.
</p><p>
"'Thirdly,&mdash;As to the wealth with which God has been pleased to bless
me and my dear Louisa and children, lovingly have we labored together
for it&mdash;lovingly we have enjoyed it&mdash;and now, with a glad and grateful
heart do I leave it among them.
</p><p>
"'I give my beloved Louisa all my ready money&mdash;that she may never
be alarmed at a sudden call.
</p><p>
"'I give her all my fat calves and lambs, my pigs and poultry&mdash;that
she may always keep a good table.
</p><p>
"'I give her my new carriage and horses&mdash;that she may visit her
friends in comfort.
</p><p>
"'I give her my family Bible&mdash;that she may live above the ill-tempers
and sorrows of life.
</p><p>
"'I give my son Peter a hornbook&mdash;for I am afraid he will always be
a dunce.'"
</p><p>
General Horry goes on to say that Peter was so stunned by this squib
that he "instantly quit his raccoon hunting by night and betook himself
to reading, and soon became a very sensible and charming young man."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62_62" id="Footnote_62_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> Mr. Howells, in his <i>Literary Boston Thirty Years Ago</i>, thus speaks of
her (1895): "I should not be just to a vivid phase if I failed to speak of
Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and the impulse of reform which she personified.
I did not sympathize with this then so much as I do now, but I could appreciate
it on the intellectual side. Once, many years later, I heard Mrs.
Howe speak in public, and it seemed to me that she made one of the best
speeches I had ever heard. It gave me for the first time a notion of what
women might do in that sort if they entered public life; but when we met
in those earlier days I was interested in her as perhaps our chief poetess.
I believe she did not care to speak much of literature; she was alert for
other meanings in life, and I remember how she once brought to book a
youthful matron who had perhaps unduly lamented the hardships of housekeeping,
with the sharp demand, 'Child, where is your <i>religion</i>?' After
the many years of an acquaintance which had not nearly so many meetings
as years, it was pleasant to find her, not long ago, as strenuous as ever
for the faith or work, and as eager to aid Stepniak as John Brown. In her
beautiful old age she survives a certain literary impulse of Boston, but a
still higher impulse of Boston she will not survive, for that will last while
the city endures."</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
